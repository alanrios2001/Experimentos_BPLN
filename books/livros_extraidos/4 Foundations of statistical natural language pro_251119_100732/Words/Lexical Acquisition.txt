p/CX /CX8 Lexical Acquisition
The topic of chapter 5 was the acquisition of collocations , phrases and
other combinations of words that have a specialized meaning or someother special behavior important in
NLP. In this chapter, we will cast our
net more widely and look at the acquisition of more complex syntacticand semantic properties of words. The general goal of lexical acquisition
lexical acquisition
is to develop algorithms and statistical techniques for ﬁlling the holesin existing machine-readable dictionaries by looking at the occurrence
patterns of words in large text corpora. There are many lexical acquisi-
tion problems besides collocations: selectional preferences (for example,the verb eatusually takes food items as direct objects), subcategorization
frames (for example, the recipient of contribute is expressed as a preposi-
tional phrase with to), and semantic categorization (what is the semantic
category of a new word that is not covered in our dictionary?). While wediscuss simply the ability of computers to learn lexical information from
online texts, rather than in any way attempting to model human language
acquisition, to the extent that such methods are successful, they tend toundermine the classical Chomskyan arguments for an innate languagefaculty based on the perceived poverty of the stimulus.
Most properties of words that are of interest in
NLPare not fully cov-
ered in machine-readable dictionaries. This is because of the productivityof natural language. We constantly invent new words and new uses of old
words. Even if we could compile a dictionary that completely covered the
language of today, it would inevitably become incomplete in a matter ofmonths. This is the reason why lexical acquisition is so important inStatistical
NLP.
A brief discussion of what we mean by lexical and the lexicon is in lexical
lexiconorder. Trask (1993: 159) deﬁnes the lexicon as:

p/CX /CX266 8 Lexical Acquisition
That part of the grammar of a language which includes the lexical lexical entries
entries for all the words and/or morphemes in the language and
which may also include various other information, depending onthe particular theory of grammar.
The ﬁrst part of the deﬁnition (“the lexical entries for all the words”)
suggests that we can think of the lexicon as a kind of expanded diction-ary that is formatted so that a computer can read it (that is, machine-
readable). The trouble is that traditional dictionaries are written for the
needs of human users, not for the needs of computers. In particular,quantitative information is completely missing from traditional dictio-naries since it is not very helpful for the human reader. So one importanttask of lexical acquisition for Statistical
NLP is to augment traditional
dictionaries with quantitative information.
The second part of the deﬁnition (“various other information, depend-
ing on the particular theory of grammar”) draws attention to the fact
that there is no sharp boundary between what is lexical information andwhat is non-lexical information. A general syntactic rule like S !NP VP
is deﬁnitely non-lexical, but what about ambiguity in the attachment ofprepositional phrases? In a sense, it is a syntactic problem, but it can beresolved by looking at the lexical properties of the verb and the noun thatcompete for the prepositional phrase as the following example shows:
(8.1) a. The children ate the cake with their hands.
b. The children ate the cake with blue icing.
We can learn from a corpus that eating is something you can do with your
hands and that cakes are objects that have icing as a part. After acquiring
these lexical dependencies between ateandhands andcake andicing ,w e
can correctly resolve the attachment ambiguities in example (8.1) suchthatwith their hands attaches to ateandwith blue icing attaches to cake.
In a sense, almost all of Statistical
NLPinvolves estimating parameters
tied to word properties, so a lot of statistical NLPwork has an element
of lexical acquisition to it. In fact, there are linguistic theories claim-
ing that all linguistic knowledge is knowledge about words (Dependency
Grammar (Mel0ˇcuk 1988), Categorial Grammar (Wood 1993), Tree Adjoin-
ing Grammar (Schabes et al. 1988; Joshi 1993), ‘Radical Lexicalism’ (Kart-tunen 1986)) and all there is to know about a language is the lexicon, thuscompletely dispensing with grammar as an independent entity. In gen-eral, those properties that are most easily conceptualized on the level

of the individual word are covered under the rubric ‘lexical acquisition.’
We have devoted separate chapters to the acquisition of collocations andword sense disambiguation simply because these are self-contained andwarrant separate treatment as central problems in Statistical
NLP.B u t
they are as much examples of lexical acquisition as the problems covered
in this chapter.
The four main areas covered in this chapter are verb subcategorization
(the syntactic means by which verbs express their arguments), attach-ment ambiguity (as in example (8.1)), selectional preferences (the seman-tic characterization of a verb’s arguments such as the fact that thingsthat get eaten are usually food items), and semantic similarity betweenwords. However, we ﬁrst begin by introducing some evaluation measures
which are commonly used to evaluate lexical acquisition methods and
various other Statistical
NLPsystems, and conclude with a more in-depth
discussion of the signiﬁcance of lexical acquisition in Statistical NLPand
some further readings.
8.1 Evaluation Measures
An important recent development in NLPhas been the use of much more
rigorous standards for the evaluation of NLP systems. It is generally
agreed that the ultimate demonstration of success is showing improvedperformance at an application task, be that spelling correction, summa-rizing job advertisements, or whatever. Nevertheless, while developing
systems, it is often convenient to assess components of the system on
some artiﬁcial performance score (such as perplexity), improvements inwhich one can expect to be reﬂected in better performance for the wholesystem on an application task.
Evaluation in Information Retrieval (IR) makes frequent use of the no-
tions of precision and recall, and their use has crossed over into workon evaluating Statistical
NLPmodels, such as a number of the systems
discussed in this chapter. For many problems, we have a set of targets
(for example, targeted relevant documents, or sentences in which a wordhas a certain sense) contained within a larger collection. Our system thendecides on a selected set (documents that it thinks are relevant, or sen-tences that it thinks contain a certain sense of a word, etc.). This situationis shown in ﬁgure 8.1. The selected and target groupings can be thought

areas counted by the ﬁgures for true and false positives and true and falsenegatives are shown in terms of the target set and the selected set. Precisionistp=jselectedj, the proportion of target (or correct) items in the selected (or

of as indicator random variables, and the joint distribution of the two
variables can be expressed as a 2 2 contingency matrix:

The numbers in each box show the frequency or count of the number of
items in each region of the space. The cases accounted for by tp(true true positives

wrongly selected cases in fpare called false positives ,false acceptances false positives
orType II errors . The cases in fnthat failed to be selected are called false Type II errors

tpfn(8.4)
In applications like IR, one can generally trade oﬀ precision and re-
call (one can select every document in the collection and get 100% recallbut very low precision, etc.). This tradeoﬀ can be plotted in a precision-recall curve, as we illustrate in section 15.1.2. Sometimes such a tradeoﬀdoesn’t make as much sense in
NLPapplications, but in any situation
where there are some items that one is more sure of than others (such as
in subcategorization frame learning in section 8.2), the same opportuni-ties for trading oﬀ precision vs. recall exist.
For this reason it can be convenient to combine precision and recall into
a single measure of overall performance. One way to do this is the Fmea-
Fmeasure
sure, a variant of the Emeasure introduced by van Rijsbergen (1979: 174), Emeasure
whereF1−E.T h eFmeasure is deﬁned as follows:
F1
1
P1−1
R(8.5)
wherePis precision,Ris recall andis a factor which determines the
weighting of precision and recall. A value of 0:5 is often chosen for
equal weighting of PandR. With thisvalue, theFmeasure simpliﬁes
to 2PR=RP.
A good question to ask is: “Wait a minute, in the table in (8.2), tptn
is the number of things I got right, and fpfnis the number of things
I got wrong. Why don’t we just report the percentage of things right or
the percentage of things wrong?” One can do that, and these measuresare known as accuracy anderror . But it turns out that these often aren’t
accuracy
errorgood measures to use because in most of the kinds of problems we look
attn, the number of non-target, non-selected things, is huge, and dwarfs
all the other numbers. In such contexts, use of precision and recall hasthree advantages:
Accuracy ﬁgures are not very sensitive to the small, but interestingnumberstp,fp,a n dfn, whereas precision and recall are. One can get
extremely high accuracy results by simply selecting nothing.
Other things being equal, the Fmeasure prefers results with more true
positives, whereas accuracy is sensitive only to the number of errors.This bias normally reﬂects our intuitions: We are interested in ﬁndingthings, even at the cost of also returning some junk.

Table 8.1 TheFmeasure and accuracy are diﬀerent objective functions. The
table shows precision, recall, Fmeasure (with 0:5) and accuracy scores for
certain selections of some number of items from out of a collection of 100,000items of which 150 are genuine targets. The upper series (a) shows increasingFmeasure values, but decreasing accuracy. The lower series (b) shows identical
accuracy scores, but again increasing Fmeasure values. The bias of the Fmea-
sure is towards maximizing the true positives, while accuracy is sensitive onlyto the number of classiﬁcation errors.
Using precision and recall, one can give a diﬀerent cost to missing
target items versus selecting junk.
Table 8.1 provides some examples which illustrate how accuracy and the
Fmeasure (with 0:5) evaluate results diﬀerently.
A less frequently used measure is fallout , the proportion of non- fallout
targeted items that were mistakenly selected.
falloutfp
fptn(8.6)
Fallout is sometimes used as a measure of how hard it is to build a sys-
tem that produces few false positives. If the number of non-targeteditems is very large, then low precision due to large fpmay be unavoid-
able because with a large background population of non-targeted items,
it is unavoidable that some will be miscategorized.
In some ﬁelds of engineering recall-fallout trade-oﬀs are more com-
mon than precision-recall trade-oﬀs. One uses a so-called ROC curve (for
ROC curve
receiver operating characteristic ) to show how diﬀerent levels of fallout
(false positives as a proportion of all non-targeted events) inﬂuence recall

or sensitivity (true positives as a proportion of all targeted events). Think
of a burglar alarm that has a knob for regulating its sensitivity. The ROC
curve will tell you, for a certain rate of false positives, what the expectedrate of true positives is. For example, for a false positives rate of being
woken up once in a hundred nights with no burglars, one might achieve
an expected rate of true positives of 95% (meaning 5% of burglaries willnot be detected).
Evaluation measures used in probabilistic parsing are discussed in sec-
tion 12.1.8, and evaluation in IR is further discussed in section 15.1.2.
8.2 Verb Subcategorization
Verbs subcategorize for diﬀerent syntactic categories as we discussed in subcategorize for
section 3.2.2. That is, they express their semantic arguments with diﬀer-
ent syntactic means. A particular set of syntactic categories that a verbcan appear with is called a subcategorization frame . Examples of subcat-
subcategorization
frame egorization frames are given in table 8.2. English verbs always subcatego-
rize for a subject, so we sometimes omit subjects from subcategorizationframes.
The phenomenon is called subcategorization because we can think of
the verbs with a particular set of semantic arguments as one category.
Each such category has several subcategories that express these seman-
tic arguments using diﬀerent syntactic means. For example, the class
of verbs with semantic arguments theme andrecipient has a subcategory
that expresses these arguments with an object and a prepositional phrase(for example, donate inHe donated a large sum of money to the church ),

p/CX /CX272 8 Lexical Acquisition
and another subcategory that in addition permits a double-object con-
struction (for example, giveinHe gave the church a large sum of money ).
Knowing the possible subcategorization frames for verbs is important
for parsing. The contrast in (8.7) shows why.
(8.7) a. She told the man where Peter grew up.
b. She found the place where Peter grew up.
If we know that tellhas the subcategorization frame NP NP S (subject,
object, clause), and that ﬁnd lacks that frame, but has the subcatego-
rization frame NP NP (subject, object), we can correctly attach the where -
clause to toldin the ﬁrst sentence (as shown in (8.8a)) and to place in the
second sentence (as shown in (8.8b)).
(8.8) a. She told [the man] [where Peter grew up].
b. She found [the place [where Peter grew up]].
Unfortunately, most dictionaries do not contain information on subcat-
egorization frames. Even if we have access to one of the few dictionariesthat do (e.g., Hornby 1974), the information on most verbs is incomplete.
According to one account, up to 50% of parse failures can be due to miss-
ing subcategorization frames.
1The most comprehensive source of sub-
categorization information for English is probably (Levin 1993). But eventhis excellent compilation does not cover all subcategorization framesand it does not have quantitative information such as the relative fre-quency of diﬀerent subcategorization frames for a verb. And the need tocope with the productivity of language would make some form of acqui-
sition from corpora necessary even if there were better sources available.
A simple and eﬀective algorithm for learning some subcategorization
frames was proposed by Brent (1993), implemented in a system calledLerner . Suppose we want to decide based on corpus evidence whether
verbvtakes framef. Lerner makes this decision in two steps.
Cues. Deﬁne a regular pattern of words and syntactic categories which
indicates the presence of the frame with high certainty. Certainty is
formalized as probability of error. For a particular cue cjwe deﬁne
a probability of error jthat indicates how likely we are to make a
mistake if we assign frame fto verbvbased on cuecj.

erences from corpora,” talk given at the workshop “Practical Acquisition of Large-ScaleLexical Information” at

p/CX /CX8.2 Verb Subcategorization 273
Hypothesis testing. The basic idea here is that we initially assume
that the frame is notappropriate for the verb. This is our null hy-
pothesisH0. We reject this hypothesis if the cue cjindicate with high
probability that our H0is wrong.
Cues. Here is the regular pattern that Brent (1993: 247) uses as the cue
for the subcategorization frame “NP NP” (transitive verbs):
(8.9) Cue for frame “NP NP”:
(OBJjSUBJ_OBJjCAP) (PUNC jCC)
where OBJ stands for personal pronouns that are necessarily accusative
(or objective) like meandhim, SUBJ_OBJ stands for personal pronouns
that can be both subjects and objects like youandit, CAP is any cap-
italized word, PUNC is a punctuation mark, and CC is a subordinatingconjunction like if,before oras.
This pattern is chosen because it is only likely to occur when a verb
indeed takes the frame “NP NP.” Suppose we have a sentence like (8.10)
which matches the instantiation “CAP PUNC” of pattern (8.9).
(8.10) [. . . ] greet-V Peter-CAP ,-PUNC [. . . ]
One can imagine a sentence like (8.11) where this pattern occurs and the
verb does not allow the frame. (The matching pattern in (8.11) is came -V
Thursday -CAP ,-PUNC.) But this case is very unlikely since a verb followed
by a capitalized word that in turn is followed by a punctuation mark will
almost always be one that takes objects and does not require any other
syntactic arguments (except of course for the subject). So the probabilityof error is very low when we posit the frame ‘NP NP’ for a verb that occurswith cue (8.9).
(8.11) I came Thursday, before the storm started.
Note that there is a tradeoﬀ between how reliable a cue is and how of-
ten it occurs. The pattern “OBJ CC” is probably even less likely to be a
misleading cue than “CAP PUNC.” But if we narrowed (8.9) down to onereliable instantiation, we might have to sift through hundreds of occur-rences of a verb to ﬁnd the ﬁrst occurrence with a cue, which would makethe test applicable only to the most frequent verbs. This is a problemwhich we will return to later.

p/CX /CX274 8 Lexical Acquisition
Hypothesis testing. Once the cues for the frames of interest have been
deﬁned, we can analyze a corpus, and, for any verb-frame combination,count the number of times that a cue for the frame occurs with the verb.Suppose that verb v
ioccurs a total of ntimes in the corpus and that there
aremnoccurrences with a cue for frame fj. Then we can reject the null
hypothesisH0thatvidoes not permit fjwith the following probability
of error:
pEPvifj0jCvi;cjmnX
rm 
n
r!
jr1−jn−r(8.12)
wherevifj0 is shorthand for ‘Verb vidoes not permit frame fj,’
Cvi;cjis the number of times that vioccurs with cue cj,a n djis the
error rate for cue fj, that is, the probability that we ﬁnd cue cjfor a
particular occurrence of the verb although the frame is not actually used.
Recall the basic idea of hypothesis testing (chapter 5, page 162): pEis
the probability of the observed data if the null hypothesis H0is correct.
IfpEis small, then we reject H0because the fact that an unlikely event
occurred indicates assuming H0was wrong. Our probability of error in
this reasoning is pE.
In equation (8.12), we assume a binomial distribution (section 2.1.9).
Each occurrence of the verb is an independent coin ﬂip for which the cuedoesn’t work with probability 
j(that is, the cue occurs, but the frame
doesn’t), and for which it works correctly with probability 1 −j(either the
cue occurs and correctly indicates the frame or the cue doesn’t occur andthus doesn’t mislead us).
2It follows that an incorrect rejection of H0has
probabilitypEif we observe mor more cues for the frame. We will reject
the null hypothesis if pE< for an appropriate level of signiﬁcance ,
for example,0:02. ForpE, we will assume that verb vidoes not
permit frame fj.
An experimental evaluation shows that Lerner does well as far as pre-
cision is concerned. For most subcategorization frames, close to 100%of the verbs assigned to a particular frame are correctly assigned (Brent1993: 255). However, Lerner does less well at recall. For the six framescovered by Brent (1993), recall ranges from 47% to 100%, but these num-bers would probably be appreciably lower if a random sample of verbtypes had been selected instead of a random sample of verb tokens,

each frame. The interested reader should consult (Brent 1993).

p/CX /CX8.2 Verb Subcategorization 275
a sampling method that results in a small proportion of low-frequency
verbs.3Since low-frequency verbs are least likely to be comprehensively
covered in existing dictionaries, they are arguably more important to getright than high-frequency verbs.
Manning (1993) addresses the problem of low recall by using a tagger
and running the cue detection (that is, the regular expression matching
for patterns like (8.9)) on the output of the tagger. It may seem worryingthat we now have two error-prone systems, the tagger and the cue detec-tor, which are combined, resulting in an even more error-prone system.However, in a framework of hypothesis testing, this is not necessarilyproblematic. The basic insight is that it doesn’t really matter how reliablea cue is as an indicator for a subcategorization frame. Even an unreliable
indicator can help us determine the subcategorization frame of a verb
reliably if it occurs often enough and we do the appropriate hypothesistesting. For example, if cue c
jwith error rate j0:25 occurs 11 out
of 80 times, then we can still reject the null hypothesis that vidoes not
permitcjwithpE0:011<0:02 despite the low reliability of cj.
Allowing low-reliability cues and additional cues based on tagger out-
put increases the number of available cues signiﬁcantly. As a result, a
much larger proportion of verb occurrences have cues for a given frame.
But more importantly, there are many subcategorization frames that haveno high-reliability cues, for example, subcategorization for a prepositionsuch as oninhe relies onrelatives orwith inshe compared the results with
earlier ﬁndings . Since most prepositions occurring after verbs are not
subcategorized for, there is simply no reliable cue for verbs subcatego-rizing for a preposition. Manning’s method can learn a larger number of
subcategorization frames, even those that have only low-reliability cues.
Table 8.3 shows a sample of Manning’s results. We can see that preci-
sion is high: there are only three errors. Two of the errors are preposi-tional phrases (PPs): to bridge between andto retire in . It is often diﬃcult
to decide whether prepositional phrases are arguments (which are sub-categorized for) or adjuncts (which aren’t). One could argue that retire
subcategorizes for the PP in Malibu in a sentence like John retires in Mal-
ibusince the verb and the PP-complement enter into a closer relationship
than mere adverbial modiﬁcation. (For example, one can infer that Johnended up living in Malibu for a long time.) But the
OALD does not list

Table 8.3 Some subcategorization frames learned by Manning’s system. For
each verb, the table shows the number of correct and incorrect subcategoriza-tion frames that were learned and the number of frames listed in the OxfordAdvanced Learner’s Dictionary (Hornby 1974). Adapted from (Manning 1993).
“NPin-PP” as a subcategorization frame, and this was what was used as
the gold standard for evaluation.
The third error in the table is the incorrect assignment of the intransi-
tive frame to remark . This is probably due to sentences like (8.13) which
look like remark is used without any arguments (except the subject).
(8.13) “And here we are 10 years later with the same problems,” Mr. Smith re-
marked.
Recall in table 8.3 is relatively low. Recall here is the proportion of sub-
categorization frames listed in the OALD that were correctly identiﬁed.
High precision and low recall are a consequence of the hypothesis testingframework adopted here. We only ﬁnd subcategorization frames that arewell attested. Conversely, this means that we do not ﬁnd subcategoriza-tion frames that are rare. An example is the transitive use of leak as in
he leaked the news , which was not found due to an insuﬃcient number
of occurrences in the corpus.
Table 8.3 is only a sample. Precision for the complete set of 40 verbs
was 90%, recall was 43%. One way to improve these results would beto incorporate prior knowledge about a verb’s subcategorization frame.While it is appealing to be able to learn just from raw data, without anyhelp from a lexicographer’s work, results will be much better if we take

pa/CX /CX8.2 Verb Subcategorization 277
prior knowledge into account. The same pattern can be strong evidence
for a new, unlisted subcategorization frame for one verb but evidencefor a diﬀerent frame with another verb. This is particularly true if wecontinue in the direction of more structured input to the subcategoriza-tion detector and use a parser instead of just a tagger. The simplest way
of specifying prior knowledge would be to stipulate a higher prior for
subcategorization frames listed in the dictionary.
As an example of how prior knowledge would improve accuracy, sup-
pose we analyze a particular syntactic pattern (say, V NP S) and ﬁnd twopossible subcategorization frames f
1(subject, object) and f2(subject,
object, clause) with a slightly higher probability for f1. This is our exam-
ple (8.8). A parser could choose f1(subject, object) for a verb for which
both frames have the same prior and f2(subject, object, clause) for a verb
for which we have entered a bias against f1using some prior knowledge.
For example, if we know that email is a verb of communication like tell,
we may want to disfavor frames without clauses, and the parser wouldcorrectly choose frame f
2(subject, object, clause) for I emailed my boss
where I had put the ﬁle with the slide presentation . Such a system based
on an incomplete subcategorization dictionary would make better use of
a corpus than the systems described here and thus achieve better results.
Exercise 8.1 [«]
A potential problem with the inclusion of low-reliability cues is that they ‘wa-
ter down’ the eﬀectiveness of high-reliability cues if we combine all cues in oneregular expression pattern, resulting in lower recall. How can we modify thehypothesis test to address this problem? Hint: Consider a multinomial distribu-tion.
Exercise 8.2 [«]
Suppose a subcategorization frame for a verb is very rare. Discuss the diﬃculty
of detecting such a frame with Brent and Manning’s methods.
Exercise 8.3 [«]
Could one sharpen the hypothesis test for a low-frequency subcategorization
framef
jby taking as the event space the set of occurrences of the verb that
could potentially be instances of the subcategorization frame? Consider a verbthat is mostly used transitively (with a direct object NP), but that has some oc-currences that subcategorize only for a PP. The methods discussed above wouldcount transitive uses as evidence against the possibility of any intransitive use.With an appropriately reduced event space, this would no longer be true. Discussadvantages and disadvantages of such an approach.

Exercise 8.4 [«]
A diﬃcult problem in an approach using a ﬁxed signiﬁcance level ( 0:02 in
Brent’s work) and a categorical classiﬁcation scheme (the verb takes a particularframe, yes/no) is to determine the threshold such that as many subcategoriza-tion classiﬁcations as possible are correct (high precision), but not too manyframes are missed (high recall). Discuss how this problem might be alleviated ina probabilistic framework in which we determine Pf
jjviinstead of making a
binary decision.
Exercise 8.5 [«]
In an approach to subcategorization acquisition based on parsing and priors,
how would you combine probabilistic parses and priors into a posterior estimateof the probability of subcategorization frames? Assume that the priors are givenin the formPf
jjvi, and that parsing a corpus gives you a number of estimates
of the formPskjfj(the probability of sentence kgiven that verb viin the
sentence occurs with frame fj).
8.3 Attachment Ambiguity
A pervasive problem in parsing natural language is resolving attachment
ambiguities. When we try to determine the syntactic structure of a sen-tence, a problem that we consider in general in chapter 12, there areoften phrases that can be attached to two or more diﬀerent nodes inthe tree, and we have to decide which one is correct. PP attachment is
the attachment ambiguity problem that has received the most attention
in the Statistical
NLPliterature. We saw an example of it in chapter 3
example (3.65), here repeated as (8.14):
(8.14) The children ate the cake with a spoon.
Depending on where we attach the prepositional phrase with a spoon ,
the sentence can either mean that the children were using a spoon to eatthe cake (the PP is attached to ate), or that of the many cakes that they
could have eaten the children ate the one that had a spoon attached (thePP is attached to cake). This latter reading is anomalous with this PP,
but would be natural for the PP with frosting . See ﬁgure 3.2 in chapter 3
for the two diﬀerent syntactic trees that correspond to the two attach-
ments. This type of syntactic ambiguity occurs in every sentence in whicha prepositional phrase follows an object noun phrase. The reason whythe sentence in (1.12) had so many parses was because there were a lotof PPs (and participial relative clauses) which can attach at various placessyntactically. In this section, we introduce a method for determining the

p/CX /CX8.3 Attachment Ambiguity 279
attachment of prepositional phrases based on lexical information that is
due to Hindle and Rooth (1993).
How are such ambiguities to be resolved? While one could imagine con-
textualizing a discourse where with a spoon was used as a diﬀerentiator
of cakes, it was natural in the above example to see it as a tool for eating,
and thus to choose the verb attachment. This seems to be true for many
naturally occurring sentences:
(8.15) a. Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan . . .
b. Sydney Water breached an agreement with NSW Health . . .
In these examples, only one attachment results in a reasonable interpre-
tation. In (8.15a), the PP into Afghanistan must attach to the verb phrase
headed by send, while in (8.15b), the PP with NSW Health must attach
to the NP headed by agreement . In cases like these, lexical preferences
can be used to disambiguate. Indeed, it turns out that, in most cases,simple lexical statistics can determine which attachment is the correctone. These simple statistics are basically co-occurrence counts betweenthe verb and the preposition on the one hand, and between the noun andthe preposition on the other. In a corpus, we would ﬁnd lots of cases
where intois used with send, but only a few where intois used with sol-
dier. So we can be reasonably certain that the PP headed by intoin (8.15a)
attaches to send,n o tt o soldiers .
A simple model based on this information is to compute the following
likelihood ratio (cf. section 5.3.4 on likelihood ratios).
v;n;plogPpjv
Ppjn(8.16)
wherePpjvis the probability of seeing a PP with pafter the verb v
andPpjnis the probability of seeing a PP with pafter the noun n.
We can then attach to the verb for v;n;p > 0 and to the noun for
v;n;p< 0.
The trouble with this model is that it ignores the fact that other things
being equal, there is a preference for attaching phrases “low” in the parse
tree. For PP attachment, the lower node is the NP node. For example, the
tree in ﬁgure 3.2 (b) attaches the PP with the spoon to the lower NP node,
the tree in ﬁgure 3.2 (a) attaches it to the higher VP node. One can explainlow attachments with a preference for local operations. When we processthe PP, the NP is still fresh in our mind and so it is easier to attach the PPto it.

Table 8.4 An example where the simple model for resolving PP attachment
ambiguity fails.
The following example from the New York Times shows why it is im-
portant to take the preference for attaching low into account:
(8.17) Chrysler conﬁrmed that it would end its troubled venture with Maserati.
The preposition with occurs frequently after both end (e.g., the show
ended with a song )a n d venture (e.g., the venture with Maserati ). The
data from the New York Times corpus in table 8.4,4when plugged into
equation (8.16), predict attachment to the verb:
Ppjv607
51560:118>0:107155
1442Ppjn
But that is the wrong decision here. The model is wrong because equa-
tion (8.16) ignores a bias for low attachment in cases where a prepositionis equally compatible with the verb and the noun. We will now develop aprobabilistic model for PP attachment that formalizes this bias.
8.3.1 Hindle and Rooth (1993)
In setting up the probabilistic model that is due to Hindle and Rooth(1993), we ﬁrst deﬁne the event space. We are interested in sentencesthat are potentially ambiguous with respect to PP attachment. So we
deﬁne the event space to consist of all clauses that have a transitive verb
(a verb with an object noun phrase), an NP following the verb (the objectnoun phrase) and a PP following the NP.
5Our goal is to resolve the PP
attachment ambiguity in these cases.
In order to reduce the complexity of the model, we limit our attention
to one preposition at a time (that is, we are not modeling possible inter-actions between PPs headed by diﬀerent prepositions, see exercise 8.8),
4. We used the subset of texts from chapter 5.
5. Our terminology here is a little bit sloppy since the PP is actually part of the NP when
it attaches to the noun, so, strictly speaking, it does not follow the NP. So what we meanhere when we say “NP” is the base NP chunk without complements and adjuncts.

p/CX /CX8.3 Attachment Ambiguity 281
and, if there are two PPs with the same preposition in sequence, then we
will only model the behavior of the ﬁrst (see exercise 8.9).
To simplify the probabilistic model, we will not directly ask the ques-
tion about whether a certain preposition is attached to a certain verb ornoun. Rather, we will estimate how likely it is in general for a preposition
to attach to a verb or noun. We will look at the following two questions,
formalized by the sets of indicator random variables VA
pand NAp:
VAp: Is there a PP headed by pand following the verb vwhich attaches
tov(VAp1) or not (VA p0)?
NAp: Is there a PP headed by pand following the noun nwhich attaches
ton(NAp1) or not (NA p0)?
Note that we are referring to any occurrence of the preposition phere
rather than to a particular instance. So it is possible for both NA pand
VApto be 1 for some value of p. For instance, this is true for ponin
the sentence:
(8.18) He put the book [ onWorld War II] [ onthe table].
For a clause containing the sequence “ v...n. . . PP,” we wish to calcu-
late the probability of the PP headed with preposition pattaching to the
verbvand the noun n, conditioned on vandn:
PVAp;NApjv;nPVApjv;nP NApjv;n (8.19)
PVApjvP NApjn (8.20)
In (8.19), we assume conditional independence of the two attachments
– that is, whether a PP occurs modifying nis independent of whether
one occurs modifying v. In (8.20), we assume that whether the verb is
modiﬁed by a PP does not depend on the noun and whether the noun ismodiﬁed by a PP does not depend on the verb.
That we are treating attachment of a preposition to a verb and to a noun
(i.e., VA
pand NAp) as independent events seems counterintuitive at ﬁrst
since the problem as stated above posits a binary choice between noun
and verb attachment. So, rather than being independent, attachment tothe verb seems to imply non-attachment to the noun and vice versa. Butwe already saw in (8.18) that the deﬁnitions of VA
pand NApimply that
both can be true. The advantage of the independence assumption is thatit is easier to derive empirical estimates for the two variables separately

p/CX /CX282 8 Lexical Acquisition
rather than estimating their joint distribution. We will see below how we
can estimate the relevant quantities from an unlabeled corpus.
Now suppose that we wish to determine the attachment of a PP that is
immediately following an object noun. We can compute an estimate interms of model (8.20) by computing the probability of NA
p1.
PAttachpnjv;nPVAp0_VAp1jvPNAp1jn
1:0PNAp1jn
PNAp1jn
So we do not need to consider whether VA p0o rV Ap1, since while
there could be other PPs in the sentence modifying the verb, they areimmaterial to deciding the status of the PP immediately after the nounhead.
In order to see that the case VA
p1a n dN Ap1 does not make
Attachpvtrue, let’s look at what these two premises entail. First,
there must be two prepositional phrases headed by a preposition of type
p. This is because we assume that any given PP can only attach to one
phrase, either the verb or the noun. Second, the ﬁrst of these two PPsmust attach to the noun, the second to the verb. If it were the other wayround, then we would get crossing brackets. It follows that VA
p1a n d
NAp1 implies that the ﬁrst PP headed by pis attached to the noun, not
to the verb. So Attach pvholds in this case.
In contrast, because there cannot be crossing lines in a phrase structure
tree, in order for the ﬁrst PP headed by the preposition pto attach to the
verb, both VA p1a n dN Ap0 must hold. Substituting the appropriate
values in model (8.20) we get:

We choose verb attachment for large positive values of and noun attach-
ment for large negative values. We can also make decisions for values of

p/CX /CX8.3 Attachment Ambiguity 283
closer to zero (verb attachment for positive and noun attachment for
negative), but there is a higher probability of error.
How do we estimate the probabilities PVAp1jvandPNAp1jn
that we need for equation (8.22)? The simplest method is to rely onmaximum likelihood estimates of the familiar form:
PVA
p1jvCv;p
Cv
PNAp1jnCn;p
Cn
whereCv andCn are the number of occurrences of vandnin the
corpus, andCv;p andCn;p are the number of times that pattaches
tovandpattaches ton. The remaining diﬃculty is to determine the
attachment counts from an unlabeled corpus. In some sentences theattachment is obvious.
(8.22) a. The road to London is long and winding.
b. She sent him into the nursery to gather up his toys.
The prepositional phrase in italics in (8.22a) must attach to the noun
since there is no preceding verb, and the italicized PP in (8.22b) must
attach to the verb since attachment to a pronoun like himis not possi-
ble. So we can bump up our counts for Croad;toandCsend;intoby
one based on these two sentences. But many sentences are ambiguous.That, after all, is the reason why we need an automatic procedure for theresolution of attachment ambiguity.
Hindle and Rooth (1993) propose a heuristic for determining Cv;p
andCn;p from unlabeled data that has essentially three steps.
1. Build an initial model by counting all unambiguous cases (examples
like (8.22a) and (8.22b)).
2. Apply the initial model to all ambiguous cases and assign them to the
appropriate count if exceeds a threshold (for example, >2:0f o r
verb attachment and <−2:0 for noun attachment).
3. Divide the remaining ambiguous cases evenly between the counts (that
is, increase both Cv;p andCn;p by 0:5 for each ambiguous case).
Sentence (8.15a), here repeated as (8.23), may serve as an example of
how the method is applied (Hindle and Rooth 1993: 109–110).

PNAinto1jsoldiersCsoldiers;into

The fractional count is due to the step of the heuristic that divides the
hardest ambiguous cases evenly between noun and verb. We also have:
PNAinto0jsoldiers1−PNAinto1jsoldiers0:9993 (8.24)
Plugging these numbers into formula (8.22), we get the following like-
lihood ratio.
send;soldiers;intolog20:0490:9993
0:00076:13
So attachment to the verb is much more likely (26:1370 times more
likely), which is the right prediction here. In general, the procedure is
accurate in about 80% of cases if we always make a choice (Hindle and
Rooth 1993: 115). We can trade higher precision for lower recall if weonly make a decision for values of that exceed a certain threshold. For
example, Hindle and Rooth (1993) found that precision was 91.7% andrecall was 55.2% for 3:0.
8.3.2 General remarks on PP attachment
Much of the early psycholinguistic literature on parsing emphasized the
use of structural heuristics to resolve ambiguities, but they clearly don’thelp in cases like the PP attachments we have been looking at. For identi-cal sequences of word classes, sometimes one parse structure is correct,and sometimes another. Rather, as suggested by Ford et al. (1982), lexicalpreferences seem very important here.
There are several major limitations to the model presented here. One
is that it only considers the identity of the preposition and the noun
and verb to which it might be attached. Sometimes other information isimportant (studies suggest human accuracy improves by around 5% whenthey see more than just a v;n;p triple). In particular, in sentences like
those in (8.25), the identity of the noun that heads the NP inside the PP isclearly crucial:

$27 a share] [at its monthly meeting].
Figure 8.2 Attachments in a complex sentence.
(8.25) a. I examined the man with a stethoscope
b. I examined the man with a broken leg
Other information might also be important. For instance Hindle and
Rooth (1993) note that a superlative adjective preceding the noun highlybiased things towards an NP attachment (in their data). This condition-ing was probably omitted by Hindle and Rooth because of the infrequentoccurrence of superlative adjectives. However, a virtue of the likelihood
ratio approach is that other factors can be incorporated in a principled
manner (providing that they are assumed to be independent). Much otherwork has used various other features, in particular the identity of thehead noun inside the PP (Resnik and Hearst 1993; Brill and Resnik 1994;Ratnaparkhi et al. 1994; Zavrel et al. 1997; Ratnaparkhi 1998). Franz(1996) is able to include lots of features within a loglinear model ap-proach, but at the cost of reducing the most basic association strength
parameters to categorical variables.
A second major limitation is that Hindle and Rooth (1993) consider
only the most basic case of a PP immediately after an NP object whichis modifying either the immediately preceding noun or verb. But thereare many more possibilities for PP attachments than this. Gibson andPearlmutter (1994) argue that psycholinguistic studies have been greatlybiased by their overconcentration on this one particular case. A PP sep-
arated from an object noun by another PP may modify any of the noun
inside the preceding PP, the object noun, or the preceding verb. Figure 8.2shows a variety of the distant and complex attachment patterns that oc-cur in texts. Additionally, in a complex sentence, a PP might not modifyjust the immediately preceding verb, but might modify a higher verb. SeeFranz (1997) for further discussion, and exercise 8.9.

p/CX /CX286 8 Lexical Acquisition
Other attachment issues
Apart from prepositional phrases, attachment ambiguity also occurs with
various kinds of adverbial and participial phrases and clauses, and in
noun compounds . The issue of the scope of coordinations in parsing is noun compounds
also rather similar to an attachment decision, but we will not consider it
further here.
A noun phrase consisting of a sequence of three or more nouns either
has the left-branching structure [[N N] N] or the right-branching structure[N [N N]]. For example, door bell manufacturer is left-branching: [[door
bell] manufacturer] . It’s a manufacturer of door bells, not a manufac-
turer of bells that somehow has to do with doors. The phrase woman
aid worker is an example of a right-branching NP: [woman [aid worker]] .
The phrase refers to an aid worker who is female, not a worker workingfor or on woman aid . The left-branching case roughly corresponds to at-
tachment of the PP to the verb ([V N P]), while the right-branching casecorresponds to attachment to the noun ([V [N P]]).
We could directly apply the formalism we’ve developed for preposi-
tional phrases to noun compounds. However, data sparseness tends tobe a more serious problem for noun compounds than for prepositionalphrases because prepositions are high-frequency words whereas mostnouns are not. For this reason, one approach is to use some form ofsemantic generalization based on word classes in combination with at-tachment information. See Lauer (1995a) for one take on the problem
(use of semantic classes for the PP attachment problem was explored by
Resnik and Hearst (1993) with less apparent success). A diﬀerent exam-ple of class-based generalization will be discussed in the next section.
As a ﬁnal comment on attachment ambiguity, note that a large pro-
portion of prepositional phrases exhibit ‘indeterminacy’ with respect toattachment (Hindle and Rooth 1993: 112). Consider the PP with them
in (8.26):
(8.26) We have not signed a settlement agreement with them .
When you sign an agreement with person X,t h e ni nm o s tc a s e si ti sa n
agreement with X, but you also do the signing with X. It is rather unclear
whether the PP should be attached to the verb or the noun or whether weshould rather say that a PP like with them in sentence (8.26) should attach
toboth verb and noun. Lauer (1995a) found that a signiﬁcant proportion
of noun compounds also had this type of attachment indeterminacy. This

p/CX /CX8.3 Attachment Ambiguity 287
is an example of a possibly important insight that came out of Statisti-
calNLPwork. Before Hindle and Rooth’s study, computational linguists
were not generally aware of how widespread attachment indeterminacyis (though see Church and Patil (1982) for a counterexample).
After becoming aware of this fact, we could just say that it doesn’t mat-
ter how we attach in indeterminate cases. But the phenomenon might
also motivate us to explore new ways of determining the contributiona prepositional phrase makes to the meaning of a sentence. The phe-nomenon of attachment indeterminacy suggests that it may not be agood idea to require that PP meaning always be mediated through a nounphrase or a verb phrase as current syntactic formalisms do.
Exercise 8.6 [«]
As is usually the case with maximum likelihood estimates, they suﬀer in accuracy
if data are sparse. Modify the estimation procedure using one of the proceduressuggested in chapter 6. Hindle and Rooth (1993) use an ‘Add One’ method intheir experiments.
Exercise 8.7 [«]
Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a partially parsed corpus to determine Cv;p , and
Cn;p . Discuss whether we could use an unparsed corpus and what additional
problems we would have to grapple with.
Exercise 8.8 [«]
Consider sentences with two PPs headed by two diﬀerent prepositions, for ex-
ample, “He put the book on Churchill in his backpack.” The model we developedcould attach on Churchill toputwhen applied to the preposition onandin his
backpack tobook when applied to the preposition in. But that is an incorrect
parse tree since it has crossing brackets. Develop a model that makes consistentdecisions for sentences with two PPs headed by diﬀerent prepositions.
Exercise 8.9 [««]
Develop a model that resolves the attachment of the second PP in a sequence of
the form: V . . . N . . . PP PP. There are three possible cases here: attachment tothe verb, attachment to the noun and attachment to the noun in the ﬁrst PP.
Exercise 8.10 [«]
Note the following diﬀerence between a) the acquisition methods for attachment
ambiguity in this section and b) those for subcategorization frames in the lastsection and those for collocations in chapter 5. In the case of PP attachment,we are interested in what is predictable . We choose the pattern that best ﬁts
what we would predict to happen from the training corpus. (For example, a PPheaded by inafter send.) In the case of subcategorization and collocations, we
are interested in what is unpredictable , that is, patterns that shouldn’t occur if
our model was right. Discuss this diﬀerence.

8.4 Selectional Preferences
Most verbs prefer arguments of a particular type. Such regularities are
called selectional preferences orselectional restrictions . Examples are that selectional
preferences
selectional
restrictionsthe objects of the verb eattend to be food items, the subjects of think
tend to be people, and the subjects of bark tend to be dogs. These seman-
ticconstraints on arguments are analogous to the syntactic constraints
we looked at earlier, subcategorization for objects, PPs, inﬁnitives etc.
We use the term preferences as opposed to rules because the preferences
can be overridden in metaphors and other extended meanings. For exam-ple,eattakes non-food arguments in eating one’s words orfear eats the
soul.
The acquisition of selectional preferences is important in Statistical
NLPfor a number of reasons. If a word like durian is missing from our
machine-readable dictionary, then we can infer part of its meaning from
selectional restrictions. In the case of sentence (8.27), we can infer that a
durian is a type of food.
(8.27) Susan had never eaten a fresh durian before.
Another important use of selectional preferences is for ranking the
possible parses of a sentence. We will give higher scores to parses wherethe verb has ‘natural’ arguments than to those with atypical arguments,a strategy that allows us to choose among parses that are equally goodon syntactic criteria. Scoring the semantic wellformedness of a sentencebased on selectional preferences is more amenable to automated lan-guage processing than trying to understand the meaning of a sentence
more fully. This is because the semantic regularities captured in selec-
tional preferences are often quite strong and, due to the tight syntacticlink between a verb and its arguments, can be acquired more easily fromcorpora than other types of semantic information and world knowledge.
We will now introduce the model of selectional preferences proposed
by Resnik (1993, 1996). In principle, the model can be applied to anyclass of words that imposes semantic constraints on a grammatically de-
pendent phrase: verb $subject, verb $direct object, verb $prepositional
phrase, adjective $noun, noun$noun (in noun-noun compounds). But
we will only consider the case ‘verb $direct object’ here, that is, the case
of verbs selecting a semantically restricted class of direct object nounphrases.
The model formalizes selectional preferences using two notions: selec-

p/CX /CX8.4 Selectional Preferences 289
tional preference strength and selectional association. Selectional prefer- selectional
preference
strengthence strength measures how strongly the verb constrains its direct object.
It is deﬁned as the KL divergence between the prior distribution of directobjects (the distribution of direct objects for verbs in general) and thedistribution of direct objects of the verb we are trying to characterize.
We make two assumptions to simplify the model. First, we only take
thehead noun of the direct object into account (for example, apple in
Susan ate the green apple ) since the head is the crucial part of the noun
phrase that determines compatibility with the verb. Second, instead ofdealing with individual nouns, we will instead look at classes of nouns.
As usual, a class-based model facilitates generalization and parameterestimation. With these assumptions, we can deﬁne selectional preference
strengthSv as follows:
SvDPCjvkPCX
cPcjvlogPcjv
Pc(8.28)
wherePC is the overall probability distribution of noun classes and
PCjvis the probability distribution of noun classes in the direct object
position ofv. We can take the noun classes from any lexical resource that
groups nouns into classes. Resnik (1996) uses WordNet.
Based on selectional preference strength, we can deﬁne selectional as- selectional
association sociation between a verb vand a classcas follows:
Av;cPcjvlogPcjv
Pc
Sv(8.29)
That is, the association between a verb and a class is deﬁned as the pro-
portion that its summand PcjvlogPcjv
Pccontributes to the overall pref-
erence strength Sv.
Finally, we need a rule for assigning association strength to nouns (as
opposed to noun classes). If the noun nis in only one class c, then
we simply deﬁne Av;nÖAv;c . If the noun is a member of several
classes, then we deﬁne its association strength as the highest associationstrength of any of its classes.

Table 8.5 Selectional Preference Strength ( SPS). The argument distributions and
selectional preference strengths of three verbs for a classiﬁcation of nouns with

In the case of chair , we have two candidate classes, ‘furniture’ and ‘peo-
ple’ (the latter in the sense ‘chairperson’). Equating Av;n with the max-
imumAv;c amounts to disambiguating the noun. In sentence (8.31) we disambiguation
will base the association strength Ainterrupt;chairon the class ‘peo-
ple’ since interrupting people is much more common than interrupting
pieces of furniture, that is:
Ainterrupt;peopleAinterrupt;furniture
Hence:Ainterrupt;chair max
c2classeschairAinterrupt;c
Ainterrupt;people
So we can disambiguate chair as a by-product of determining the associ-
ation of interrupt andchair .
The hypothetical data in table 8.5 (based on (Resnik 1996: 139)) may
serve as a further illustration of the model. The table shows the prior dis-tribution of object NPs over noun classes (assuming that there are onlythe four classes shown) and posterior distributions for three verbs. Theverb eatoverwhelmingly prefers food items as arguments; see’s distri-
bution is not very diﬀerent from the prior distribution since all physicalobjects can be seen; ﬁnd has a uniform distribution over the ﬁrst three
classes, but ‘disprefers’ actions since actions are not really the type of
entities that are found.
The selectional preference strengths of the three verbs are shown in
the row ‘SPS.’ The numbers conform well with our intuition about thethree verbs: eatis very speciﬁc with respect to the arguments it can take,
ﬁnd is less speciﬁc, and seehas no selectional preferences (at least in

p/CX /CX8.4 Selectional Preferences 291
our hypothetical data). Note that there is a clear interpretation of SPS
as the amount of information we gain about the argument after learning
about the verb. In the case of eat,SPSis 1.76, corresponding to almost 2
binary questions. That is just the number of binary questions we need toget from four classes (people, furniture, food, action) to one, namely the
class ‘food’ that eatselects. (Binary logarithms were used to compute
SPS
and association strength.)
Computing the association strengths between verbs and noun classes,
we ﬁnd that the class ‘food’ is strongly preferred by eat(8.32) whereas
the class ‘action’ is dispreferred by ﬁnd(8.33). This example shows that
the model formalizes selectional ‘dispreferences’ (negative numbers) aswell as selectional preferences (positive numbers).

The association strengths between seeand all four noun classes are zero,

noun that is a member of two classes c1andc2occurs withv, then we
assign half of this occurrence to Pv;c 1and half toPv;c 2.
So far, we have only presented constructed examples. Table 8.6 shows
some actual data from Resnik’s experiments on the Brown corpus (Resnik1996: 142). The verbs and nouns were taken from a psycholinguisticstudy (Holmes et al. 1989). The nouns in the left and right halves ofthe table are ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ objects, respectively. For most verbs,

Table 8.6 Association strength distinguishes a verb’s plausible and implausible
objects. The left half of the table shows typical objects, the right half shows
atypical objects. In most cases, association strength Av;n is a good predictor
of object typicality.
association strength accurately predicts which object is typical. For ex-
ample, it correctly predicts that friend is a more natural object for see
than method . Most errors the model makes are due to the fact that it
performs a form of disambiguation, by choosing the highest association
strength among the possible classes of the noun (cf. the example of chair
we discussed earlier). Even if a noun is an atypical object, if it has arare interpretation as a plausible object, then it will be rated as typical.A ne x a m p l eo ft h i si s hear. Both story andissue can be forms of commu-
nication, but this meaning is rarer for issue . Yet the model chooses the
rare interpretation because it makes more sense for the verb hear.
Apart from the speciﬁc question of selectional preference, Resnik also
investigates how well the model predicts whether or not a verb has the
so-called implicit object alternation (orunspeciﬁed object alternation , see
implicit object
alternation Levin (1993: 33)). An example is the alternation between sentences (8.35a)
and (8.35b). The verb eatalternates between explicitly naming what was
eaten (8.35a) and leaving the thing eaten implicit (8.35b).
(8.35) a. Mike ate the cake.
b. Mike ate.
The explanation Resnik oﬀers for this phenomenon is that the more
constraints a verb puts on its object, the more likely it is to permit theimplicit-object construction. The intuition is that for a verb like eatwith a
strong selectional preference, just knowing the verb gives us so much in-

pa/CX /CX8.4 Selectional Preferences 293
formation about the direct object that we don’t have to mention it. Resnik
ﬁnds evidence that selectional preference strength is a good predictor ofthe permissibility of the implicit-object alternation for verbs.
We can now see why Resnik’s model deﬁnes selectional preference
strength (
SPS) as the primary concept and derives association strength
from it. SPSis seen as the more basic phenomenon which explains the
occurrence of implicit objects as well as association strength.
An alternative is to deﬁne association strength directly as Pcjv–o r
asPnjvif we don’t want to go through an intermediate class represen-
tation. Approaches to computing Pnjvinclude distributional clustering
(the work by Pereira et al. (1993) described in chapter 14) and methodsfor computing the similarity of nouns. If a measure of the similarity of
nouns is available, then Pnjvcan be computed from the distribution of
nouns similar to nthat are found in the argument slot of v. See the next
section for more on this approach.
Exercise 8.11 [«]
As we pointed out above, we can use a model of selectional preferences for dis-
ambiguating nouns by computing the association strengths for diﬀerent sensesof the noun. This strategy assumes that we know what the senses of the nounare and which classes they are members of. How could one use selectional pref-erences to discover senses of nouns whose senses we don’t know?
Exercise 8.12 [«]
Verbs can also be ambiguous as in the case of ﬁrein these two sentences.
(8.36) a. The president ﬁred the chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer.
b. Mary ﬁred her gun ﬁrst.
How can the model be used to disambiguate verbs? Consider two scenarios, one
in which we have a training set in which verb senses are labeled, one in which wedon’t.
Exercise 8.13 [«]
The model discussed in this section assigns the noun sense with the maximum
association strength. This approach does not take prior probabilities into ac-count. We may not want to choose an extremely rare sense of a noun even if itis the best ﬁt as the object NP of a verb.
Example: The noun shot has the rare meaning ‘marksman’ as in John was reputed
t ob eac r a c ks h o t . So, theoretically, we could choose this sense for shot in
the sentence John ﬁred a shot , corresponding to the meaning John laid oﬀ a
marksman .
How could prior probabilities be used to avoid such incorrect inferences?

Exercise 8.14 [««]
In the approach developed above, WordNet is treated as a ﬂat set of noun classes,
but it is actually a hierarchy. How could one make use of the information presentin the hierarchy (for example, the fact, that the class ‘dog’ is a subclass of ‘animal’which in turn is a subclass of ‘entity’)?
Exercise 8.15 [««]
Verbs can be organized into a hierarchy too. How could one use hierarchical
information about verbs for better parameter estimation?
Exercise 8.16 [«]
One assumption of the model is that it is the head noun that determines the
compatibility of an object NP with the selectional preferences of the verb. How-ever, as pointed out by Resnik (1996: 137), that is not always the case. Examplesinclude negation ( you can’t eat stones ), and certain adjectival modiﬁers ( he ate
a chocolate ﬁretruck ;the tractor beam pulled the ship closer ); neither stones
nor ﬁretrucks are compatible with the selectional preferences of eat, but these
sentences are still well-formed. Discuss this problem.
Exercise 8.17 [«]
Hindle and Rooth (1993) go through several iterations of estimating initial pa-
rameters of their model, disambiguating some ambiguous attachments and re-
estimating parameters based on disambiguated instances. How could this ap-
proach be used to estimate the prior probabilities of noun classes in (8.34)?The goal would be to improve on the uniform distribution over possible classesassumed in the equation.
Exercise 8.18 [«]
Resnik’s model expresses association strength as a proportion of selectional
preference strength. This leads to interesting diﬀerences from an approachbased on formalizing selectional preference as Pnjv. Compare two noun-verb
pairs with equal Pnjv, that is,Pn
1jv1Pn 2jv2. If the selectional prefer-
ence strength of v1is much larger than that of v2, then we get Av 1;cn 1
Av 2;cn 2. So the two models make diﬀerent predictions here. Discuss these
diﬀerences.
8.5 Semantic Similarity
The holy grail of lexical acquisition is the acquisition of meaning. There
are many tasks (like text understanding and information retrieval) forwhich Statistical
NLPcould make a big diﬀerence if we could automati-
cally acquire meaning. Unfortunately, how to represent meaning in a waythat can be operationally used by an automatic system is a largely un-solved problem. Most work on acquiring semantic properties of words

p/CX /CX8.5 Semantic Similarity 295
has therefore focused on semantic similarity . Automatically acquiring a semantic similarity
relative measure of how similar a new word is to known words (or how
dissimilar) is much easier than determining what the meaning actually is.
Despite its limitations, semantic similarity is still a useful measure to
have. It is most often used for generalization under the assumption that generalization
semantically similar words behave similarly. An example would be the
problem of selectional preferences that we discussed in the previoussection. Suppose we want to ﬁnd out how appropriate durian is as an
argument of eatin sentence (8.37) (our previous example (8.27)):
(8.37) Susan had never eaten a fresh durian before.
Suppose further that we don’t have any information about durian except
that it’s semantically similar to apple ,banana ,a n d mango , all of which
perfectly ﬁt the selectional preferences of eat. Then we can generalize
from the behavior of apple ,banana ,a n d mango to the semantically sim-
ilardurian and hypothesize that durian is also a good argument of eat.
This scheme can be implemented in various ways. We could base ourtreatment of durian only on the closest semantic neighbor (say, mango ),
or we could base it on a combination of evidence from a ﬁxed number of
nearest neighbors, a combination that can be weighted according to howsemantically similar each neighbor is to durian .
Similarity-based generalization is a close relative of class-based gener-
class-based
generalization alization. In similarity-based generalization we only consider the closest
neighbors in generalizing to the word of interest. In class-based general-ization, we consider the whole class of elements that the word of interest
is most likely to be a member of. (See exercise 8.20.)
Semantic similarity is also used for query expansion in information re-
trieval. A user who describes a request for information in her own wordsmay not be aware of related terms which are used in the documents thatthe user would be most interested in. If a user describes a request fordocuments on Russian space misions using the word astronaut , then a
query expansion system can suggest the term cosmonaut based on the
semantic similarity between astronaut andcosmonaut .
Another use of semantic similarity is for so-called knearest neighbors
knearest neighbors
(orKNN ) classiﬁcation, see section 16.4). We ﬁrst need a training set of KNN
elements that are each assigned to a category. The elements might be
words and the categories might be topic categories as they are used bynewswire services (‘ﬁnancial,’ ‘agriculture,’ ‘politics’ etc.). In
KNN classi-

p/CX /CX296 8 Lexical Acquisition
ﬁcation we assign a new element to the category that is most prevalent
among itsknearest neighbors.
Before delving into the details of how to acquire measures of semantic
similarity, let us remark that semantic similarity is not as intuitive andclear a notion as it may seem at ﬁrst. For some, semantic similarity is an
extension of synonymy and refers to cases of near-synonymy like the pair
dwelling /abode . Often semantic similarity refers to the notion that two
words are from the same semantic domain ortopic . On this understand-
semantic domain
topicing of the term, words are similar if they refer to entities in the world that
are likely to co-occur like doctor ,nurse ,fever ,a n d intravenous ,w o r d s
that can refer to quite diﬀerent entities or even be members of diﬀerentsyntactic categories.
One attempt to put the notion of semantic similarity on a more solid
footing is provided by Miller and Charles (1991), who show that judge-ments of semantic similarity can be explained by the degree of contextual
contextual
interchangeability interchangeability or the degree to which one word can be substituted for
another in context.
Note that ambiguity presents a problem for all notions of semantic
similarity. If a word is semantically similar to one sense of an ambiguous
word, then it is rarely semantically similar to the other sense. For exam-
ple,litigation is similar to the legal sense of suit, but not to the ‘clothes’
sense. When applied to ambiguous words, semantically similar usuallymeans ‘similar to the appropriate sense’.
8.5.1 Vector space measures
A large class of measures of semantic similarity are best conceptualizedas measures of vector similarity. The two words whose semantic similar-ity we want to compute are represented as vectors in a multi-dimensionalspace. Figures 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 give (constructed) examples of such multi-dimensional spaces (see also ﬁgure 15.5).
The matrix in ﬁgure 8.3 represents words as vectors in document space .
document space
Entryaijcontains the number of times word joccurs in document i.
Words are deemed similar to the extent that they occur in the same doc-
uments. In document space, cosmonaut andastronaut are dissimilar (no
shared documents); truck andcarare similar since they share a docu-
ment: they co-occur in d4.
The matrix in ﬁgure 8.4 represents words as vectors in word space . word space

Co-occurrence can be deﬁned with respect to documents, paragraphs or
other units. Words are similar to the extent that they co-occur with thesame words. Here, cosmonaut andastronaut are more similar than before
since they both co-occur with moon .
We have deﬁned co-occurrence in ﬁgure 8.4 with respect to the doc-
uments in ﬁgure 8.3. In other words, the following relationship holds:BA

phrases) as vectors in modiﬁer space . Entrycijcontains the number of modiﬁer space
times that head jis modiﬁed by modiﬁer i. Heads are similar to the ex-
tent that they are modiﬁed by the same modiﬁers. Again, cosmonaut and
astronaut are similar. But, interestingly moon is dissimilar from cosmo-
naut andastronaut here, in contrast to the document space in ﬁgure 8.3
and the word space in ﬁgure 8.4. This contrast demonstrates that diﬀer-
ent spaces get at diﬀerent types of semantic similarity. The type of un-diﬀerentiated co-occurrence information in document and word spacescaptures topical similarity (words pertaining to the same topic domain).
topical similarity
Head-modiﬁer information is more ﬁne-grained. Although astronaut and
moon are part of the same domain (‘space exploration’), they are obvi-
ously entities with very diﬀerent properties (a human being versus a
celestial body). Diﬀerent properties correspond to diﬀerent modiﬁers,
which explains why the two words come out as dissimilar on the head-modiﬁer metric.
6
The three matrices also have an interesting interpretation if we look
at the similarity of rows instead of the similarity of columns (or, equiv-
alently, look at the similarity of columns of the transposed matrices).Looking at the matrices this way, Adeﬁnes similarity between docu-
ments. This is the standard way of deﬁning similarity among documents
and between documents and queries in information retrieval. Matrix C
deﬁnes similarity between modiﬁers when transposed. For example, red
andoldare similar (they share carandtruck ), suggesting that they are
used to modify the same types of nouns. Matrix Bissymmetric ,s o
looking at similarity of rows is no diﬀerent from looking at similarityof columns.
So far we have appealed to an intuitive notion of vector similarity. Ta-
ble 8.7 deﬁnes several measures that have been proposed to make thisnotion precise (adapted from (van Rijsbergen 1979: 39)). At ﬁrst, we onlyconsider binary vectors , that is, vectors with entries that are either 0 or 1.
binary vectors
The simplest way to describe a binary vector is as the set of dimensions
on which it has non-zero values. So, for example, the vector for cosmo-
naut in ﬁgure 8.5 can be represented as the set fSoviet;spacewalking g.
Having done this, we can calculate similarities using set operations, as in
table 8.7.
6. See Grefenstette (1996) and Schütze and Pedersen (1997) for a discussion of the pros
and cons of measuring word similarity based on associations versus head-modiﬁer rela-tionships.

Table 8.7 Similarity measures for binary vectors.
The ﬁrst similarity measure, the matching coeﬃcient , simply counts the matching
coefﬁcient number of dimensions on which both vectors are non-zero. In contrast
to the other measures, it does not take into account the length of thevectors and the total number of non-zero entries in each.
7
TheDice coeﬃcient normalizes for length by dividing by the total num- Dice coefﬁcient
ber of non-zero entries. We multiply by 2 so that we get a measure that
ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 indicating identical vectors.
TheJaccard coeﬃcient penalizes a small number of shared entries (as Jaccard coefﬁcient
a proportion of all non-zero entries) more than the Dice coeﬃcient does.
Both measures range from 0.0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (perfect overlap), but theJaccard coeﬃcient gives lower values to low-overlap cases. For example,two vectors with ten non-zero entries and one common entry get a Dicescore of 21=10100:1 and a Jaccard score of 1 =1010−10:05.
The Jaccard coeﬃcient is frequently used in chemistry as a measure ofsimilarity between chemical compounds (Willett and Winterman 1986).
TheOverlap coeﬃcient has the ﬂavor of a measure of inclusion. It has
Overlap coefﬁcient
a value of 1.0 if every dimension with a non-zero value for the ﬁrst vector
is also non-zero for the second vector or vice versa (in other words ifXYorYX).
Thecosine is identical to the Dice coeﬃcient for vectors with the same

number of non-zero entries (see exercise 8.24), but it penalizes less in
cases where the number of non-zero entries is very diﬀerent. For ex-
ample, if we compare one vector with one non-zero entry and anothervector with 1000 non-zero entries and if there is one shared entry, then
7. This can be desirable to reﬂect our conﬁdence in the similarity judgement. Hindle
(1990) recommends a measure for noun similarity with this property.

p/CX /CX300 8 Lexical Acquisition
we get a Dice coeﬃcient of 2 1=110000:002 and a cosine of
1=p
100010:03. This property of the cosine is important in Statisti-
calNLPsince we often compare words or objects that we have diﬀerent
amounts of data for, but we don’t want to say they are dissimilar justbecause of that.
So far we have looked at binary vectors, but binary vectors only have
one bit of information on each dimension. A more powerful represen-tation for linguistic objects is the real-valued vector space .W e w i l l n o t

give a systematic introduction to linear algebra here, but let us brieﬂy
review the basic concepts of vector spaces that we need in this book.A real-valued vector ~xof dimensionality nis a sequence of nreal num-
bers, wherex
idenotes theithcomponent of ~x(its value on dimension i).
The components of a vector are properly written as a column:
~x0

However, we sometimes write vectors horizontally within paragraphs. We
writeR

n,s ow eh a v e~x2Rn. In a Euclidean vector space, the length of a vector length of a vector
is deﬁned as follows.
j~xjrXn

i (8.39)
Finally, the dot product between two vectors is deﬁned as ~x~yPn
i1xiyi.
The cosine, the last similarity measure we introduced for binary vec-
tors, is also the most important one for real-valued vectors. The cosine
measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It ranges from 1.0(cos0
1:0) for vectors pointing in the same direction over 0.0 for or-
thogonal vectors (cos 900:0) to−1:0 for vectors pointing in opposite
directions (cos 180−1:0).
For the general case of two n-dimensional vectors ~xand~yin a real-
valued space, the cosine measure can be calculated as follows:

the two vectors to scale for the magnitude of the individual xiandyi.
We call a vector normalized if it has unit length according to the Eu- normalization
clidean norm:
jxjnX
i1x2
i1 (8.41)
For normalized vectors, the cosine is simply the dot product:
cos~x;~y~x~y (8.42)
TheEuclidean distance between two vectors measures how far apart Euclidean distance
they are in the vector space:
j~x−~yjrXn
i1xi−yi2 (8.43)
An interesting property of the cosine is that, if applied to normalized
vectors, it will give the same ranking of similarities as Euclidean distancedoes. That is, if we only want to know which of two objects is closest toa third object, then cosine and Euclidean distance give the same answerfor normalized vectors. The following derivation shows why ranking ac-cording to cosine and Euclidean distance comes out to be the same:
j~x−~yj

Finally, the cosine has also been used as a similarity measure of prob-
ability distributions (Goldszmidt and Sahami 1998). Two distributionsfp

cosine of the two resulting vectors gives the measure DPn
i1ppiqi,
which can be interpreted as the sum over the geometric means of thefp

words (after elimination of the 100 most frequent words in both cases).Instead of raw co-occurrence counts, we used the logarithmic weightingfunctionfx1logxfor non-zero counts (see section 15.2.2). A co-
occurrence event was deﬁned as two words occurring within 25 words
of each other. The table shows cosine similarities between rows of the
matrix.
For some word pairs, cosine in word space is a good measure of se-
mantic similarity. The neighbors of garlic are generally close in meaning
to garlic (with the possible exception of cup) .T h es a m ei st r u ef o r fallen .
Note, however, that grammatical distinctions are not reﬂected becauseco-occurrence information is insensitive to word order and grammatical
dependencies (the past participle fallen and the past tense fellare near-
est neighbors of each other). The word engineered shows the corpus-
dependency of the similarity measure. In the New York Times , the word
is often used in the context of genetic engineering. A corpus of automo-bile magazine articles would give us a very diﬀerent set of neighbors ofengineered . Finally, the words Alfred andsimple show us the limits of
the chosen similarity measure. Some of the neighbors of Alfred are also
names, but this is a case of part-of-speech similarity rather than seman-
tic similarity. The neighbors of simple seem completely random. Since
simple is frequently used and its occurrences are distributed throughout
the corpus, co-occurrence information is not useful here to characterizethe semantics of the word.
The examples we have given demonstrate the advantage of vector

p/CX /CX8.5 Semantic Similarity 303
spaces as a representational medium: their simplicity. It is easy to visu-
alize vectors in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Equatingsimilarity with the extent to which the vectors point in the same directionis equally intuitive. In addition, vector space measures are easy to com-pute. Intuitive simplicity and computational eﬃciency are probably the
main reasons that vector space measures have been used for a long time
in information retrieval, notably for word-by-document matrices (Lesk1969; Salton 1971a; Qiu and Frei 1993). Work on using vector measuresfor word-by-word and modiﬁer-by-head matrices is more recent (Grefen-stette 1992b; Schütze 1992b). See (Grefenstette 1992a) and (Burgess andLund 1997) for research demonstrating that vector-based similarity mea-sures correspond to psychological notions of semantic similarity such as
the degree to which one word primes another.
priming
8.5.2 Probabilistic measures
The problem with vector space based measures is that, except for the
cosine, they operate on binary data (yes or no). The cosine is the onlyvector space measure that accommodates quantitative information, but it
has its own problems. Computing the cosine assumes a Euclidean space.
This is because the cosine is deﬁned as the ratio of the lengths of twosides of a triangle. So we need a measure of length, the Euclidean met-ric. But a Euclidean space is not a well-motivated choice if the vectorswe are dealing with are vectors of probabilities or counts – which is whatmost representations for computing semantic similarity are based on. Tosee this observe that the Euclidean distance between the probabilities 0 :0
and 0:1 is the same as the distance between the probabilities 0 :9a n d1:0.
But in the ﬁrst case we have the diﬀerence between impossibility anda chance of 1 in 10 whereas in the second there is only a small diﬀer-ence of about 10%. The Euclidean distance is appropriate for normallydistributed quantities, not for counts and probabilities.
Matrices of counts like those in ﬁgures 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 can be easily
transformed into matrices of conditional probabilities by dividing each
element in a row by the sum of all entries in the row (this amounts to
using maximum likelihood estimates). For example, in the matrix in ﬁg-ure 8.5, the entry for American;astronautwould be transformed into
PAmericanjastronaut

20:5. The question of semantic similarity
can then be recast as a question about the similarity (or dissimilarity) oftwo probability distributions.

Secondly, KL divergence is asymmetric, that is, usually DpkqDqkp.

distribution? IRad ranges from 0 for identical distributions to 2 log 2 formaximally diﬀerent distributions (see exercise 8.26). As usual we assume
0 log 00.
A third measure considered by Dagan et al. (1997b) is the L
1(orMan- L1norm
Manhattan norm hattan )norm . It also has the desirable properties of being symmetric and
well-deﬁned for arbitrary pandq. We can interpret it as a measure of the
expected proportion of diﬀerent events , that is, as the expected propor-
8. Note that in clustering, asymmetry can make sense since we are comparing two diﬀer-
ent entities, the individual word that we need to assign to a cluster and the representationof the cluster. The question here is how well the cluster represents the word which isdiﬀerent from similarity in the strict sense of the word. See (Pereira et al. 1993).

andq. This is because1

is the expected proportion of trials with the same outcome.9
As an example consider the following conditional distributions com-

So if we looked at the sets of adjectives that occurred with a large number
of uses of cosmonaut andastronaut in a corpus, then the overlap of the
two sets would be expected to be 0.5, corresponding to the proportion of
occurrences of spacewalking with each noun.
Dagan et al. (1997b) compared the three dissimilarity measures (KL,
IRad, andL1) on a task similar to the selectional preferences problem in
section 8.4. Instead of looking at the ﬁt of nouns as argument of verbs,they looked at the ﬁt of verbs as predicates for nouns. For example, givena choice of the verbs make andtake the similarity measures were used to
determine that make is the right verb to use with plans (make plans )a n d
take is the right verb to use with actions (take actions ).

Dagan et al. (1997b) show that IRad consistently performs better than
KL andL1. Consequently, they recommend IRad as the measure that is
best to use in general.
This concludes our brief survey of measures of semantic similarity and
dissimilarity. Vector space measures have the advantage of conceptualsimplicity and of producing a similarity value that can be directly used
for generalization. But they lack a clear interpretation of the computed
measure. Probabilistic dissimilarity measures are on a more solid footingtheoretically, but require an additional transformation to get to a mea-sure of similarity that can be used for nearest neighbor generalization. Ei-ther approach is valuable in acquiring semantic properties of words fromcorpora by using similarity to transfer knowledge from known words tothose that are not covered in the lexicon.
Exercise 8.19 [«]
Similarity-based generalization depends on the premise that similar things be-
have similarly. This premise is unobjectionable if the two uses of the word simi-
larhere refer to the same notion. But it is easy to fall into the trap of interpreting
10. For the experiments, Sn was chosen to be the entire set of nouns, but one can limit
the words considered to those closest to the target word.

them diﬀerently. In that case, similarity-based generalization can give inaccurate
results.
Find examples of such potentially dangerous cases, that is, examples where
words that are similar with respect to one aspect behave very diﬀerently withrespect to another aspect.
Exercise 8.20 [«]
Similarity-based and class-based generalization are more closely related than it
may seem at ﬁrst glance. Similarity-based generalization looks at the closestneighbors and weights the input from these neighbors according to their sim-ilarity. Class-based generalization looks at the most promising class and, inthe simplest case, generalizes the novel word to the average of that class. Butclass-based generalization can be made to look like similarity-based generaliza-
tion by integrating evidence from all classes and weighting it according to how
well the element ﬁts into each class. Similarity-based generalization looks likeclass-based generalization if we view each element as a class.
Discuss the relationship between the two types of generalization. What role do
eﬃciency considerations play?
Exercise 8.21 [«]
Co-occurrence matrices like the one in ﬁgure 8.3 represent diﬀerent types of in-
formation depending on how co-occurrence is deﬁned. What types of wordswould you expect ﬁreto be similar to for the following deﬁnitions of co-
occurrence: co-occurrence within a document; co-occurrence within a sentence;co-occurrence with words at a maximum distance of three words to the right;co-occurrence with the word immediately adjacent to the right. (See Finch andChater (1994) and Schütze (1995) for two studies that show how the latter typeof immediate co-occurrence can be used to discover syntactic categories.)
Exercise 8.22 [««]
The measures we have looked at compare simple objects like vectors and proba-
bility distributions. There have also been attempts to measure semantic similar-ity between more complex objects like trees (see (Sheridan and Smeaton 1992)for one example). How could one measure the (semantic?) similarity betweentrees? How might such an approach lead to a better measure of semantic simi-larity between words than ‘ﬂat’ structures?
Exercise 8.23 [«]
Select two words heading columns in ﬁgure 8.3 and compute pairwise similar-
ities using each of the measures in table 8.7 for each of the three matrices inﬁgures 8.3 through 8.5.
Exercise 8.24 [«]
Show that dice and cosine coeﬃcients are identical if the two vectors compared

Exercise 8.25 [«]
Semantic similarity can be context-dependent. For example, electrons and tennis
balls are similar when we are talking about their form (both have a round shape)and dissimilar when we are talking about their sizes.
Discuss to what extent similarity is context-dependent and when this can hinder
correct generalization.
Exercise 8.26 [«]
Show that divergence to the average (IRad) is bounded by 2 log 2.
Exercise 8.27 [«]
Select two words heading columns in ﬁgure 8.3 and compute the three measures
of dissimilarity in table 8.9 for each of the matrices in ﬁgures 8.3 through 8.5.You will have to smooth the probabilities for KL divergence. Are the dissimilaritymeasures asymmetric for KL divergence?

In this context, the Euclidean norm is also referred to as L2.S o t h eL1norm
can be seen as a more appropriate version of the Euclidean norm for probabilitydistributions.
Another norm that has been used for vectors is L
1, that isLpforp!1 (Salton
et al. 1983). What well-known function does L1correspond to?
Exercise 8.29 [«]
Does a dissimilarity measure of 0 on one of the measures in table 8.9 imply that
the other two measures are 0 too?
Exercise 8.30 [«]
If two probability distributions are maximally dissimilar according to one mea-
sure in table 8.9 (e.g., IRad p;q2 log 2), does that imply that they are maxi-

8.6 The Role of Lexical Acquisition in Statistical NLP
Lexical acquisition plays a key role in Statistical NLPbecause available lex-
ical resources are always lacking in some way. There are several reasonsfor this.

p/CX /CX8.6 The Role of Lexical Acquisition in Statistical NLP 309
One reason is the cost of building lexical resources manually. For many
types of lexical information, professional lexicographers will collect moreaccurate and comprehensive data than automatic procedures. But oftenmanually constructed dictionaries are not available due to the cost oftheir construction. One estimate for the average time it takes to create
a lexical entry from scratch is half an hour (Neﬀ et al. 1993; obviously it
depends on the complexity of the entry), so manual resource constructioncan be quite expensive.
There is one type of data that humans, including lexicographers, are
notoriously bad at collecting: quantitative information. So the quantita-tive part of lexical acquisition almost always has to be done automati-cally, even if excellent manually constructed lexical resources are avail-
able for qualitative properties.
More generally, many lexical resources were designed for human con-
sumption. The ﬂip side of quantitative information being missing (whichmay be less important for people) is that the computer has no accessto contextual information that is necessary to interpret lexical entries inconventional dictionaries. This is expressed aptly by Mercer (1993): “onecannot learn a new language by reading a bilingual dictionary.” An ex-
ample is the irregular plural postmen which is not listed as an exception
in the lexical entry of postman in some dictionaries because it is obvious
to a human reader that the plural of postman is formed in analogy to
the plural of man. The best solution to problems like these is often the
augmentation of a manual resource by automatic means.
Despite the importance of these other considerations motivating au-
tomated lexical acquisition, the main reason for its importance is the
inherent productivity of language. Natural language is in a constant state
productivity
of ﬂux, adapting to the changing world by creating names and words to
refer to new things, new people and new concepts. Lexical resources haveto be updated to keep pace with these changes. Some word classes aremore likely to have coverage gaps than others. Most documents will men-tion proper nouns that we have not encountered before whereas therewill hardly ever be newly created auxiliaries or prepositions. But the cre-
ativity of language is not limited to names. New nouns and verbs also
occur at a high rate in many texts. Words that are covered in the diction-ary may still need the application of lexical acquisition methods becausethey develop new senses or new syntactic usage patterns.
How can we quantify the amount of lexical information that has to be
learned automatically, even if lexical resources are available? For a rough

assessment, we can consult Zipf’s law and other attempts to estimate the
proportion of as yet unseen words and uses in text (see chapter 6 and,for example, (Baayen and Sproat 1996) and (Youmans 1991)).
A more detailed analysis is provided in (Sampson 1989). Sampson
tested the coverage of a dictionary with close to 70,000 entries (the
OALD , lexical coverage
Hornby 1974) for a 45,000 word subpart of the LOBcorpus. (Numbers
were not counted as words.) He found that about 3% of tokens were not
listed in the dictionary. It is instructive to look at the diﬀerent types of
words that are the cause of coverage problems. Table 8.10 lists the majortypes found by Sampson and some examples.
More than half of the missing words were proper nouns. The other
half is due to the other categories in the table. Some of the coverageproblems would be expected not to occur in a larger dictionary (somefrequent proper nouns and words like unassailable ). But based on Samp-
son’s ﬁndings, one would expect between one and two percent of tokens
in a corpus to be missing from even a much larger dictionary. It is also im-portant to note that this type of study only gets at character strings thatare entirely missing from the dictionary. It is much harder to estimateat what rate known words are used with new senses or in novel syntacticconstructions. Finally, the one to two percent of unknown words tend to

p/CX /CX8.6 The Role of Lexical Acquisition in Statistical NLP 311
be among the most important in a document: the name of the person pro-
ﬁled in an article or the abbreviation for a new scientiﬁc phenomenon. Soeven if novel words constitute only a small percentage of the text, havingan operational representation for their properties is paramount.
It took a long time until the limitations of dictionaries and hand-crafted
knowledge bases for successful language processing became clear to
NLP
researchers. A common strategy in early NLPresearch was to focus on a
small subdomain to attack what seemed to be the two most fundamentalproblems: parsing and knowledge representation. As a result of thisfocus on small subdomains, this early research “provided nothing forgeneral use on large-scale texts” and “work in computational linguisticswas largely inapplicable to anything but to sub-languages of very limited
semantic and syntactic scope” (Ide and Walker 1992).
Problems of lexical coverage started to take center stage in the late
eighties when interest shifted from subdomains to large corpora and ro-bust systems, partly due to the inﬂuence of speech recognition research.One of the earliest pieces of work on lexical acquisition from corpora wasdone for the
FORCE 4 system developed by Walker and Amsler (1986) at
SRIInternational. Since then, lexical acquisition has become one of the
most active areas of Statistical NLP.
What does the future hold for lexical acquisition? One important trend
is to look harder for sources of prior knowledge that can constrain theprocess of lexical acquisition. This is in contrast to earlier work that triedto start ‘from scratch’ and favored deriving everything from the corpus.Prior knowledge can be discrete as is the case when a lexical hierarchy like
WordNet is used or probabilistic , for example, when a prior distribution
over object noun classes is derived from a verb’s dictionary entry and
this prior distribution is then reﬁned based on corpora. Much of the hardwork of lexical acquisition will be in building interfaces that admit easyspeciﬁcation of prior knowledge and easy correction of mistakes made inautomatic learning.
One important source of prior knowledge should be linguistic theory,
which has been surprisingly underutilized in Statistical
NLP. In addition
to the attempts we have discussed here to constrain the acquisition pro-
cess using linguistic insights, we refer the reader to Pustejovsky et al.(1993), Boguraev and Pustejovsky (1995), and Boguraev (1993) for workthat takes linguistic theory as the foundation of acquisition. The lasttwo articles summarize the important work on computational lexicogra-phy done at Cambridge University (described in detail in (Boguraev and

p/CX /CX312 8 Lexical Acquisition
Briscoe 1989)), which, although mostly non-statistical, contains impor-
tant insights on how to combine theoretical linguistics and empirical ac-quisition from lexical resources.
Dictionaries are only one source of information that can be important
in lexical acquisition in addition to text corpora. Other sources are en-
cyclopedias, thesauri, gazeteers, collections of technical vocabulary and
any other reference work or data base that is likely to contribute to acharacterization of the syntactic and semantic properties of uncommonwords and names.
The reader may have wondered why we have limited ourselves to tex-
tual sources. What about speech, images, video? Lexical acquisition hasfocused on text because words are less ambiguous descriptors of content
than features that can be automatically extracted from audio and visual
data. But we can hope that, as work on speech recognition and imageunderstanding progresses, we will be able to ground the linguistic rep-resentation of words in the much richer context that non-textual mediaprovide. It has been estimated that the average educated person readson the order of one million words in a year, but hears ten times as manywords spoken. If we succeed in emulating human acquisition of language
by tapping into this rich source of information, then a breakthrough in
the eﬀectiveness of lexical acquisition can be expected.
8.7 Further Reading
There are several books and special issues of journals on lexical acqui-
sition: (Zernik 1991a), (Ide and Walker 1992), (Church and Mercer 1993),
and (Boguraev and Pustejovsky 1995). More recent work is covered inlater issues of Computational Linguistics ,Natural Language Engineering ,
andComputers and the Humanities . In what follows, we point the reader
to some of the work on lexical acquisition we were not able to cover.
Other approaches to the resolution of attachment ambiguity include
transformation-based learning (Brill and Resnik 1994) and loglinear mod-
els (Franz 1997). Collins and Brooks (1995) used a back-oﬀ model to
address data sparseness issues. Attachment ambiguity in noun phrasesalso occurs in Romance languages. See (Bourigault 1993) for French and(Basili et al. 1997) for Italian.
An alternative to Resnik’s information-theoretic approach to the acqui-
sition of selectional preferences is work by Li and Abe (1995) that uses a

p/CX /CX8.7 Further Reading 313
Minimum Description Length framework. In (Li and Abe 1996), this work
is extended to take into account the dependency between two or morearguments of a verb. For example, drive can take caras a subject ( This
car drives well ), but only if there is no object. This type of regularity
can only be discovered we we look at all arguments of the verb simulta-
neously. See also (Velardi and Pazienza 1989) and (Webster and Marcus
1989) for early (non-probabilistic, but corpus-based) work on selectionalpreferences.
Once we have acquired information about the selectional preferences
of a verb, we can exploit this knowledge to acquire subcategorizationframes, the ﬁrst problem we looked at in this chapter. Pozna ´nski and
Sanﬁlippo (1995) and Aone and McKee (1995) take this approach. For
example, a verb that takes an NP of type ‘beneﬁciary’ or ‘recipient’ is
likely to subcategorize for a to-PP.
Apart from semantic similarity, the automatic enhancement of hierar-
chies has been another focus in the area of acquiring semantics. Hearstand Schütze (1995) and Hearst (1992) describe systems that insert newwords into an existing semantic hierarchy and Coates-Stephens (1993)and Paik et al. (1995) do the same for proper nouns. Riloﬀ and Shep-
herd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998) assign words to categories
assuming a ﬂat category structure (which can be regarded as a simpliﬁedsemantic hierarchy).
Two other important types of semantic information that attempts have
been made to acquire from corpora are antonyms (Justeson and Katz1991) and metaphors (Martin 1991).
We suggested above that non-textual data are a worthwhile source of
information to exploit. There are some research projects that investigate
how lexical acquisition could take advantage of such data once the prob-lem of how to automatically build a representation of the context of anutterance has been solved. Suppes et al. (1996) stress the importance ofaction-oriented matching between linguistic forms and their contextualmeaning (as opposed to acquiring word meaning from passive percep-tion). Siskind (1996) shows that even if the contextual representation is
highly ambiguous (as one would expect in a realistic learning situation),
lexical acquisition can proceed successfully.
As a last source of information for acquiring meaning, we mention
work on exploiting morphology for this purpose. An example of a mor-phological regularity that implies a particular type of meaning is the pro-gressive tense. In English, only non-stative verbs occur in the progressive

p/CX /CX314 8 Lexical Acquisition
tense. Oversimplifying somewhat, we can infer from the fact that we ﬁnd
he is running in a corpus, but not he is knowing that know is stative and
runis non-stative. See (Dorr and Olsen 1997), (Light 1996) and (Viegas
et al. 1996) for work along these lines. While none of these papers takea statistical approach, such morphological information could be a fertile
ground for applying statistical methods.
We conclude these bibliographic remarks by pointing the reader to
two important bodies of non-statistical work that warrant careful studyby anybody interested in lexical acquisition. They are of great poten-tial importance either because they suggest ways of combining statisti-cal approaches with symbolic approaches (as in the regular-expressionpost-ﬁltering of collocations in (Justeson and Katz 1995b)) or because
the insights they oﬀer can often be expressed in a statistical framework
as well as in a non-statistical framework, making them a valuable sourcefor future statistical work.
The ﬁrst area is the work on building syntactic and semantic know-
ledge bases from machine-readable dictionaries described by Boguraevand Briscoe (1989) and Jensen et al. (1993). These two books are agood starting point for those who want to learn about the strengths and
weaknesses of dictionaries for lexical acquisition. We have focused on
corpus-based acquisition here because that has been the bias in Statisti-cal
NLP, but we believe that most future work will combine corpus-based
and dictionary-based acquisition.
The second area is the application of regular expression matching to
natural language processing. (See (Appelt et al. 1993), (Jacquemin 1994),(Voutilainen 1995), (Sproat et al. 1996), and (Jacquemin et al. 1997) for
examples.) There are phenomena and processing steps in lexical acqui-
sition that deal with purely symbolic information and that can be wellmodeled in terms of regular languages. (Tokenization of English is anexample.) In such cases, the speed and simplicity of ﬁnite state automatacannot be matched by other methods (Roche and Schabes 1997; Levineet al. 1992).
