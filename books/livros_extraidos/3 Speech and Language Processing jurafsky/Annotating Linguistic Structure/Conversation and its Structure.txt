CHAPTER
25Conversation and its Structure
Conversation is an intricate and complex joint activity, and conversations have struc-
ture. This is true of all conversations, whether they are conversations between people
or conversations between people and language models. Understanding the structure
of human conversations is an important social science and linguistic task. The con-
cepts we introduce in studying human conversation can also be a useful tool for
analyzing human-LLM conversations.
[This draft is the initial stub of a chapter that will introduce different kinds of
conversational structure and how to annotate them computationally.]
25.1 Properties of Human Conversation
What are the conversational phenomena that take place when humans converse with
each other? Are conversations between humans and machines different? Consider
what goes on in the conversation between a human travel agent and a human client
excerpted in Fig. 25.1.
C1: . . . I need to travel in May.
A2: And, what day in May did you want to travel?
C3: OK uh I need to be there for a meeting that’s from the 12th to the 15th.
A4: And you’re ﬂying into what city?
C5: Seattle.
A6: And what time would you like to leave Pittsburgh?
C7: Uh hmm I don’t think there’s many options for non-stop.
A8: Right. There’s three non-stops today.
C9: What are they?
A10: The ﬁrst one departs PGH at 10:00am arrives Seattle at 12:05 their time.
The second ﬂight departs PGH at 5:55pm, arrives Seattle at 8pm. And the
last ﬂight departs PGH at 8:15pm arrives Seattle at 10:28pm.
C11: OK I’ll take the 5ish ﬂight on the night before on the 11th.
A12: On the 11th? OK. Departing at 5:55pm arrives Seattle at 8pm, U.S. Air
ﬂight 115.
C13: OK.
A14: And you said returning on May 15th?
C15: Uh, yeah, at the end of the day.
A16: OK. There’s #two non-stops . . . #
C17: #Act. . . actually #, what day of the week is the 15th?
A18: It’s a Friday.
C19: Uh hmm. I would consider staying there an extra day til Sunday.
A20: OK. . . OK. On Sunday I have . . .

570 CHAPTER 25 • C ONVERSATION AND ITS STRUCTURE
25.1.1 Turns
A dialogue is a sequence of turns (C1, A2, C3, and so on), each a single contribution turn
from one speaker to the dialogue (as if in a game: I take a turn, then you take a turn,
then me, and so on). There are 20 turns in Fig. 25.1. A turn can consist of a sentence
(like C 1), although it might be as short as a single word (C 13) or as long as multiple
sentences (A 10).
Turn structure has important implications for spoken dialogue. A human has
to know when to stop talking; the client interrupts (in A 16and C 17), so a system
that was performing this role must know to stop talking (and that the user might be
making a correction).
The same issues come up for LLMs; a system also has to know when to start
talking. For example, most of the time in conversation, speakers start their turns
almost immediately after the other speaker ﬁnishes, without a long pause, because
people are can usually predict when the other person is about to ﬁnish talking.
Spoken language models must also detect whether a user is done speaking, so
they can process the utterance and respond. This task—called endpointing orend- endpointing
point detection — can be quite challenging because of noise and because people
often pause in the middle of turns.
25.1.2 Speech Acts
A key insight into conversation—due originally to the philosopher Wittgenstein
(1953) but worked out more fully by Austin (1962)—is that each utterance in a
dialogue is a kind of action being performed by the speaker. These actions are com-
monly called speech acts ordialogue acts : here’s one taxonomy consisting of 4 speech acts
major classes (Bach and Harnish, 1979):
Constatives: committing the speaker to something’s being the case ( answering ,claiming ,
conﬁrming ,denying ,disagreeing ,stating )
Directives: attempts by the speaker to get the addressee to do something ( advising ,ask-
ing,forbidding ,inviting ,ordering ,requesting )
Commissives: committing the speaker to some future course of action ( promising, planning,
vowing, betting, opposing )
Acknowledgments: express the speaker’s attitude regarding the hearer with respect to some so-
cial action ( apologizing ,greeting ,thanking ,accepting an acknowledgment )
A user asking a person or a dialogue system to do something (‘Turn up the mu-
sic’) is issuing a D IRECTIVE . Asking a question that requires an answer is also
a way of issuing a D IRECTIVE : in a sense when the system says (A 2) “what day
in May did you want to travel?” it’s as if the system is (very politely) command-
ing the user to answer. By contrast, a user stating a constraint (like C 1‘I need to
travel in May’) is issuing a C ONSTATIVE . A user thanking the system is issuing
an A CKNOWLEDGMENT . The speech act expresses an important component of the
intention of the speaker (or writer) in saying what they said.
25.1.3 Grounding
A dialogue is not just a series of independent speech acts, but rather a collective act
performed by the speaker and the hearer. Like all collective acts, it’s important for
the participants to establish what they both agree on, called the common groundcommon
ground
(Stalnaker, 1978). Speakers do this by grounding each other’s utterances. Ground- grounding

25.1 • P ROPERTIES OF HUMAN CONVERSATION 571
ing means acknowledging that the hearer has understood the speaker (Clark, 1996).
(People need grounding for non-linguistic actions as well; the reason an elevator but-
ton lights up when it’s pressed is to acknowledge that the elevator has indeed been
called, essentially grounding your action of pushing the button (Norman, 1988).)
Grounding is also important when the hearer needs to indicate that the speaker
hasnotsucceeded in performing an action. If the hearer has problems in under-
standing, she must indicate these problems to the speaker, again so that mutual un-
derstanding can eventually be achieved.
How is closure achieved? Clark and Schaefer (1989) introduce the idea that each
joint linguistic act or contribution has two phases, called presentation andaccep- contribution
tance . In the ﬁrst phase, a speaker presents the hearer with an utterance, performing
a sort of speech act. In the acceptance phase, the hearer has to ground the utterance,
indicating to the speaker whether understanding was achieved.
What methods can the hearer B use to ground the speaker A’s utterance? Clark
and Schaefer (1989) discuss a continuum of methods ordered from weakest to strongest:
Continued attention: B shows she is continuing to attend and therefore remains satisﬁed with
A’s presentation.
Next contribution: B starts in on the next relevant contribution.
Acknowledgment: B nods or says a continuer like uh-huh ,yeah , or the like, or an assess-
ment likethat’s great .
Demonstration: B demonstrates all or part of what she has understood A to mean, for
example, by reformulating (paraphrasing) A’s utterance or by collabo-
rative completion of A’s utterance.
Display: B displays verbatim all or part of A’s presentation.
Examples of these kind of grounding occur in the travel agent conversation. We
can ground by explicitly saying “OK”, as the agent does in A 8or A 10. Or we can
ground by repeating what the other person says; in utterance A 2the agent repeats
“in May”, demonstrating her understanding to the client. Or notice that when the
client answers a question, the agent begins the next question with “And”. The “And”
implies that the new question is ‘in addition’ to the old question, again indicating to
the client that the agent has successfully understood the answer to the last question.
This particular fragment doesn’t have an example of an acknowledgment , but
there’s an example in another fragment:
C:He wants to ﬂy from Boston to Baltimore
A:Uh huh
The word uh-huh here is a continuer , also often called an acknowledgment to- continuer
kenor abackchannel . A continuer is a (short) optional utterance that acknowledges backchannel
the content of the utterance of the other and that doesn’t require an acknowledgment
by the other (Yngve, 1970; Jefferson, 1984; Schegloff, 1982; Ward and Tsukahara,
2000).
25.1.4 Subdialogues and Dialogue Structure
Conversations have structure. Consider, for example, the local structure between
speech acts discussed in the ﬁeld of conversation analysis (Sacks et al., 1974).conversation
analysis
QUESTIONS set up an expectation for an ANSWER . PROPOSALS are followed by
ACCEPTANCE (orREJECTION ). C OMPLIMENTS (“Nice jacket!”) often give rise to
DOWNPLAYERS (“Oh, this old thing?”). These pairs, called adjacency pairs , are adjacency pair

572 CHAPTER 25 • C ONVERSATION AND ITS STRUCTURE
composed of a ﬁrst pair part and a second pair part (Schegloff, 1968), and these
expectations can help systems decide what actions to take.
However, dialogue acts aren’t always followed immediately by their second pair
part. The two parts can be separated by a side sequence (Jefferson 1972) or sub- side sequence
dialogue . For example utterances C 17to A 20constitute a correction subdialogue subdialogue
(Litman 1985, Litman and Allen 1987, Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1998):
C17: #Act. . . actually#, what day of the week is the 15th?
A18: It’s a Friday.
C19: Uh hmm. I would consider staying there an extra day til Sunday.
A20: OK. . . OK. On Sunday I have . . .
The question in C 17interrupts the prior discourse, in which the agent was looking
for a May 15 return ﬂight. The agent must answer the question and also realize that
‘’I would consider staying...til Sunday” means that the client would probably like to
change their plan, and now go back to ﬁnding return ﬂights, but for the 17th.
Another side sequence is the clariﬁcation question , which can form a subdia-
logue between a REQUEST and a RESPONSE . This is especially common in dialogue
systems where speech recognition errors causes the system to have to ask for clari-
ﬁcations or repetitions like the following:
User: What do you have going to UNKNOWN WORD on the 5th?
System: Let’s see, going where on the 5th?
User: Going to Hong Kong.
System: OK, here are some ﬂights...
In addition to side-sequences, questions often have presequences , like the fol- presequence
lowing example where a user starts with a question about the system’s capabilities
(“Can you make train reservations”) before making a request.
User: Can you make train reservations?
System: Yes I can.
User: Great, I’d like to reserve a seat on the 4pm train to New York.
25.1.5 Initiative
Sometimes a conversation is completely controlled by one participant. For exam-
ple a reporter interviewing a chef might ask questions, and the chef responds. We
say that the reporter in this case has the conversational initiative (Carbonell, 1970; initiative
Nickerson, 1976). In normal human-human dialogue, however, it’s more common
for initiative to shift back and forth between the participants, as they sometimes
answer questions, sometimes ask them, sometimes take the conversations in new di-
rections, sometimes not. You may ask me a question, and then I respond asking you
to clarify something you said, which leads the conversation in all sorts of ways. We
call such interactions mixed initiative (Carbonell, 1970).
Full mixed initiative, while the norm for human-human conversations, can be
difﬁcult for dialogue systems. The most primitive dialogue systems tend to use
system-initiative , where the system asks a question and the user can’t do anything
until they answer it, or user-initiative like simple search engines, where the user
speciﬁes a query and the system passively responds. Even modern large language
model-based dialogue systems, which come much closer to using full mixed initia-
tive, often don’t have completely natural initiative switching. Getting this right is an
important goal for modern systems.

25.1.6 Inference and Implicature
Inference is also important in dialogue understanding. Consider the client’s response
C2, repeated here:
A2: And, what day in May did you want to travel?
C3: OK uh I need to be there for a meeting that’s from the 12th to the 15th.
Notice that the client does not in fact answer the agent’s question. The client
merely mentions a meeting at a certain time. What is it that licenses the agent to
infer that the client is mentioning this meeting so as to inform the agent of the travel
dates?
The speaker seems to expect the hearer to draw certain inferences; in other
words, the speaker is communicating more information than seems to be present
in the uttered words. This kind of example was pointed out by Grice (1975, 1978)
as part of his theory of conversational implicature .Implicature means a particu- implicature
lar class of licensed inferences. Grice proposed that what enables hearers to draw
these inferences is that conversation is guided by a set of maxims , general heuristics
that play a guiding role in the interpretation of conversational utterances. One such
maxim is the maxim of relevance which says that speakers attempt to be relevant, relevance
they don’t just utter random speech acts. When the client mentions a meeting on the
12th, the agent reasons ‘There must be some relevance for mentioning this meeting.
What could it be?’. The agent knows that one precondition for having a meeting
(at least before Web conferencing) is being at the place where the meeting is held,
and therefore that maybe the meeting is a reason for the travel, and if so, then since
people like to arrive the day before a meeting, the agent should infer that the ﬂight
should be on the 11th.
These subtle characteristics of human conversations ( turns ,speech acts ,ground-
ing,dialogue structure ,initiative , and implicature ) are among the reasons it is dif-
ﬁcult to build dialogue systems that can carry on natural conversations with humans.
Many of these challenges are active areas of dialogue systems research.
25.2 Dialog Acts and Corpora
The ideas of speech acts and grounding are combined in a single kind of action
called a dialogue act , a tag which represents the interactive function of the sentence dialogue act
being tagged.
Dialog acts can be used to analyze human-human conversation or human-LLM
conversation. Both the nature of the participants and the type of dialogue (task-based
or not task-based) inﬂuence the development of dialogue act tagsets.
Figure 25.2 shows a domain-speciﬁc tagset for the task of two people scheduling
meetings. It has tags speciﬁc to the domain of scheduling, such as S UGGEST , used
for the proposal of a particular date to meet, and A CCEPT and R EJECT , used for
acceptance or rejection of a proposal for a date, but also tags that have a more general
function, like C LARIFY , used to request a user to clarify an ambiguous proposal.
Figure 25.3 shows a tagset for a restaurant recommendation system, and Fig. 25.4
shows these tags labeling a sample dialogue from the HIS system (Young et al.,
2010). This example also shows the content of each dialogue acts, which are the slot
ﬁllers being communicated.
There are a number of more general and domain-independent dialogue act tagsets.

speech act functions, and backward-looking functions, like grounding and answer-
ing, which “look back” to the interlocutor’s previous utterance (Allen and Core,
