22Lexicons for Sentiment, Affect,
and Connotation
Some day we’ll be able to measure the power of words
Maya Angelou
In this chapter we turn to tools for interpreting affective meaning, extending our affective
study of sentiment analysis in Appendix K. We use the word ‘affective’, following
the tradition in affective computing (Picard, 1995) to mean emotion, sentiment, per-
sonality, mood, and attitudes. Affective meaning is closely related to subjectivity , subjectivity
the study of a speaker or writer’s evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations
(Wiebe et al., 1999).
How should affective meaning be deﬁned? One inﬂuential typology of affec-
tive states comes from Scherer (2000), who deﬁnes each class of affective states by
factors like its cognitive realization and time course (Fig. 22.1).
Emotion: Relatively brief episode of response to the evaluation of an external
or internal event as being of major signiﬁcance.
(angry, sad, joyful, fearful, ashamed, proud, elated, desperate )
Mood: Diffuse affect state, most pronounced as change in subjective feeling, of
low intensity but relatively long duration, often without apparent cause.
(cheerful, gloomy, irritable, listless, depressed, buoyant )
Interpersonal stance: Affective stance taken toward another person in a spe-
ciﬁc interaction, coloring the interpersonal exchange in that situation.
(distant, cold, warm, supportive, contemptuous, friendly )
Attitude: Relatively enduring, affectively colored beliefs, preferences, and pre-
dispositions towards objects or persons.
(liking, loving, hating, valuing, desiring )
Personality traits: Emotionally laden, stable personality dispositions and be-
havior tendencies, typical for a person.
(nervous, anxious, reckless, morose, hostile, jealous )
Figure 22.1 The Scherer typology of affective states (Scherer, 2000).
We can design extractors for each of these kinds of affective states. Appendix K
already introduced sentiment analysis , the task of extracting the positive or negative
orientation that a writer expresses in a text. This corresponds in Scherer’s typology
to the extraction of attitudes : ﬁguring out what people like or dislike, from affect-
rich texts like consumer reviews of books or movies, newspaper editorials, or public
sentiment in blogs or tweets.
Detecting emotion andmoods is useful for detecting whether a student is con-
fused, engaged, or certain when interacting with a tutorial system, whether a caller
to a help line is frustrated, whether someone’s blog posts or tweets indicated depres-
sion. Detecting emotions like fear in novels, for example, could help us trace what
groups or situations are feared and how that changes over time.

Detecting different interpersonal stances can be useful when extracting infor-
mation from human-human conversations. The goal here is to detect stances like
friendliness or awkwardness in interviews or friendly conversations, for example for
summarizing meetings or ﬁnding parts of a conversation where people are especially
excited or engaged, conversational hot spots that can help in meeting summariza-
tion. Detecting the personality of a user—such as whether the user is an extrovert
or the extent to which they are open to experience — can help improve conversa-
tional agents, which seem to work better if they match users’ personality expecta-
tions (Mairesse and Walker, 2008). And affect is important for generation as well
as recognition; synthesizing affect is important for conversational agents in various
domains, including literacy tutors such as children’s storybooks, or computer games.
In Appendix K we introduced the use of naive Bayes classiﬁcation to classify a
document’s sentiment. Various classiﬁers have been successfully applied to many of
these tasks, using all the words in the training set as input to a classiﬁer which then
determines the affect status of the text.
In this chapter we focus on an alternative model, in which instead of using every
word as a feature, we focus only on certain words, ones that carry particularly strong
cues to affect or sentiment. We call these lists of words affective lexicons orsenti-
ment lexicons . These lexicons presuppose a fact about semantics: that words have
affective meanings orconnotations . The word connotation has different meanings connotations
in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the aspects of a word’s meaning that
are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, sentiment, opinions, or evaluations. In
addition to their ability to help determine the affective status of a text, connotation
lexicons can be useful features for other kinds of affective tasks, and for computa-
tional social science analysis.
In the next sections we introduce basic theories of emotion, show how sentiment
lexicons are a special case of emotion lexicons, and mention some useful lexicons.
We then survey three ways for building lexicons: human labeling, semi-supervised,
and supervised. Finally, we talk about how to detect affect toward a particular entity,
and introduce connotation frames.
22.1 Deﬁning Emotion
One of the most important affective classes is emotion , which Scherer (2000) deﬁnes emotion
as a “relatively brief episode of response to the evaluation of an external or internal
event as being of major signiﬁcance”.
Detecting emotion has the potential to improve a number of language processing
tasks. Emotion recognition could help dialogue systems like tutoring systems detect
that a student was unhappy, bored, hesitant, conﬁdent, and so on. Automatically
detecting emotions in reviews or customer responses (anger, dissatisfaction, trust)
could help businesses recognize speciﬁc problem areas or ones that are going well.
Emotion can play a role in medical NLP tasks like helping diagnose depression or
suicidal intent. Detecting emotions expressed toward characters in novels might
play a role in understanding how different social groups were viewed by society at
different times.
Computational models of emotion in NLP have mainly been based on two fami-
lies of theories of emotion (out of the many studied in the ﬁeld of affective science).
In one of these families, emotions are viewed as ﬁxed atomic units, limited in num-
ber, and from which others are generated, often called basic emotions (Tomkins basic emotions

22.1 • D EFINING EMOTION 499
1962, Plutchik 1962), a model dating back to Darwin. Perhaps the most well-known
of this family of theories are the 6 emotions proposed by Ekman (e.g., Ekman 1999)
to be universally present in all cultures: surprise, happiness, anger, fear, disgust,
sadness . Another atomic theory is the Plutchik (1980) wheel of emotion, consisting
of 8 basic emotions in four opposing pairs: joy–sadness ,anger–fear ,trust–disgust ,
andanticipation–surprise , together with the emotions derived from them, shown in
Fig. 22.2.
Figure 22.2 Plutchik wheel of emotion.
The second class of emotion theories widely used in NLP views emotion as a
space in 2 or 3 dimensions (Russell, 1980). Most models include the two dimensions
valence andarousal , and many add a third, dominance . These can be deﬁned as:
valence: the pleasantness of the stimulus
arousal: the level of alertness, activeness, or energy provoked by the stimulus
dominance: the degree of control or dominance exerted by the stimulus or the
emotion
Sentiment can be viewed as a special case of this second view of emotions as points
in space. In particular, the valence dimension, measuring how pleasant or unpleasant
a word is, is often used directly as a measure of sentiment.
In these lexicon-based models of affect, the affective meaning of a word is gen-
erally ﬁxed, irrespective of the linguistic context in which a word is used, or the
dialect or culture of the speaker. By contrast, other models in affective science repre-
sent emotions as much richer processes involving cognition (Barrett et al., 2007). In
appraisal theory , for example, emotions are complex processes, in which a person
considers how an event is congruent with their goals, taking into account variables
like the agency, certainty, urgency, novelty and control associated with the event
(Moors et al., 2013). Computational models in NLP taking into account these richer
theories of emotion will likely play an important role in future work.

22.2 Available Sentiment and Affect Lexicons
A wide variety of affect lexicons have been created and released. The most basic
lexicons label words along one dimension of semantic variability, generally called
“sentiment” or “valence”.
In the simplest lexicons this dimension is represented in a binary fashion, with
a wordlist for positive words and a wordlist for negative words. The oldest is the
General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), which drew on content analysis and on earlyGeneral
Inquirer
work in the cognitive psychology of word meaning (Osgood et al., 1957). The Gen-
eral Inquirer has a lexicon of 1915 positive words and a lexicon of 2291 negative
words (as well as other lexicons discussed below). The MPQA Subjectivity lexicon
(Wilson et al., 2005) has 2718 positive and 4912 negative words drawn from prior
lexicons plus a bootstrapped list of subjective words and phrases (Riloff and Wiebe,
2003). Each entry in the lexicon is hand-labeled for sentiment and also labeled for
reliability (strongly subjective or weakly subjective). The polarity lexicon of Hu
and Liu (2004) gives 2006 positive and 4783 negative words, drawn from product
reviews, labeled using a bootstrapping method from WordNet.
Positive admire, amazing, assure, celebration, charm, eager, enthusiastic, excellent, fancy, fan-
tastic, frolic, graceful, happy, joy, luck, majesty, mercy, nice, patience, perfect, proud,
rejoice, relief, respect, satisfactorily, sensational, super, terriﬁc, thank, vivid, wise, won-
derful, zest
Negative abominable, anger, anxious, bad, catastrophe, cheap, complaint, condescending, deceit,
defective, disappointment, embarrass, fake, fear, ﬁlthy, fool, guilt, hate, idiot, inﬂict, lazy,
miserable, mourn, nervous, objection, pest, plot, reject, scream, silly, terrible, unfriendly,
vile, wicked
Figure 22.3 Some words with consistent sentiment across the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), the
MPQA Subjectivity lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and the polarity lexicon of Hu and Liu (2004).
Slightly more general than these sentiment lexicons are lexicons that assign each
word a value on all three affective dimensions. The NRC Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance (V AD) lexicon (Mohammad, 2018a) assigns valence, arousal, and dom-
inance scores to 20,000 words. Some examples are shown in Fig. 22.4.

delightful .918 party .840 authority .935

consolation .408 effortless .120 discouraged .0090
torture .115 napping .046 weak .045
Figure 22.4 Values of sample words on the emotional dimensions of Mohammad (2018a).
The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, also called EmoLex (Moham- EmoLex
mad and Turney, 2013), uses the Plutchik (1980) 8 basic emotions deﬁned above.
The lexicon includes around 14,000 words including words from prior lexicons as
well as frequent nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. Values from the lexicon for
some sample words:

LIWC ,Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count , is a widely used set of 73 lex- LIWC
icons containing over 2300 words (Pennebaker et al., 2007), designed to capture
aspects of lexical meaning relevant for social psychological tasks. In addition to
sentiment-related lexicons like ones for negative emotion ( bad, weird, hate, prob-
lem, tough ) and positive emotion ( love, nice, sweet ), LIWC includes lexicons for
categories like anger, sadness, cognitive mechanisms, perception, tentative, and in-
hibition, shown in Fig. 22.6.
There are various other hand-built affective lexicons. The General Inquirer in-
cludes additional lexicons for dimensions like strong vs. weak, active vs. passive,
overstated vs. understated, as well as lexicons for categories like pleasure, pain,
virtue, vice, motivation, and cognitive orientation.
Another useful feature for various tasks is the distinction between concrete concrete
words like banana orbathrobe andabstract words like belief andalthough . The abstract
lexicon in Brysbaert et al. (2014) used crowdsourcing to assign a rating from 1 to 5
of the concreteness of 40,000 words, thus assigning banana ,bathrobe , and bagel 5,
belief 1.19, although 1.07, and in between words like brisk a 2.5.
22.3 Creating Affect Lexicons by Human Labeling
The earliest method used to build affect lexicons, and still in common use, is to have
humans label each word. This is now most commonly done via crowdsourcing : crowdsourcing
breaking the task into small pieces and distributing them to a large number of anno-

tators. Let’s take a look at some of the methodological choices for two crowdsourced
emotion lexicons.
The NRC Emotion Lexicon (EmoLex) (Mohammad and Turney, 2013), labeled
emotions in two steps. To ensure that the annotators were judging the correct sense
of the word, they ﬁrst answered a multiple-choice synonym question that primed
the correct sense of the word (without requiring the annotator to read a potentially
confusing sense deﬁnition). These were created automatically using the headwords
associated with the thesaurus category of the sense in question in the Macquarie
dictionary and the headwords of 3 random distractor categories. An example:
Which word is closest in meaning (most related) to startle?
•automobile
•shake
•honesty
•entertain
For each word (e.g. startle ), the annotator was then asked to rate how associated
that word is with each of the 8 emotions ( joy,fear,anger , etc.). The associations
were rated on a scale of not,weakly ,moderately , and strongly associated. Outlier
ratings were removed, and then each term was assigned the class chosen by the ma-
jority of the annotators, with ties broken by choosing the stronger intensity, and then
the 4 levels were mapped into a binary label for each word (no and weak mapped to
0, moderate and strong mapped to 1).
The NRC V AD Lexicon (Mohammad, 2018a) was built by selecting words and
emoticons from prior lexicons and annotating them with crowd-sourcing using best-
worst scaling (Louviere et al. 2015, Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2017). In best-best-worst
scaling
worst scaling, annotators are given N items (usually 4) and are asked which item is
thebest (highest) and which is the worst (lowest) in terms of some property. The
set of words used to describe the ends of the scales are taken from prior literature.
For valence, for example, the raters were asked:
Q1. Which of the four words below is associated with the MOST happi-
ness / pleasure / positiveness / satisfaction / contentedness / hopefulness
OR LEAST unhappiness / annoyance / negativeness / dissatisfaction /

22.4 • S EMI-SUPERVISED INDUCTION OF AFFECT LEXICONS 503
melancholy / despair? (Four words listed as options.)
Q2. Which of the four words below is associated with the LEAST hap-
piness / pleasure / positiveness / satisfaction / contentedness / hopeful-
ness OR MOST unhappiness / annoyance / negativeness / dissatisfaction
/ melancholy / despair? (Four words listed as options.)
The score for each word in the lexicon is the proportion of times the item was chosen
as the best (highest V/A/D) minus the proportion of times the item was chosen as the
worst (lowest V/A/D). The agreement between annotations are evaluated by split-
half reliability : split the corpus in half and compute the correlations between thesplit-half
reliability
annotations in the two halves.
22.4 Semi-supervised Induction of Affect Lexicons
Another common way to learn sentiment lexicons is to start from a set of seed words
that deﬁne two poles of a semantic axis (words like good orbad), and then ﬁnd ways
to label each word wby its similarity to the two seed sets. Here we summarize two
families of seed-based semi-supervised lexicon induction algorithms, axis-based and
graph-based.
22.4.1 Semantic Axis Methods
One of the most well-known lexicon induction methods, the Turney and Littman
(2003) algorithm, is given seed words like good orbad, and then for each word wto
be labeled, measures both how similar it is to good and how different it is from bad.
Here we describe a slight extension of the algorithm due to An et al. (2018), which
is based on computing a semantic axis .
In the ﬁrst step, we choose seed words by hand. There are two methods for
dealing with the fact that the affect of a word is different in different contexts: (1)
start with a single large seed lexicon and rely on the induction algorithm to ﬁnetune
it to the domain, or (2) choose different seed words for different genres. Hellrich
et al. (2019) suggests that for modeling affect across different historical time periods,
starting with a large modern affect dictionary is better than small seedsets tuned to be
stable across time. As an example of the second approach, Hamilton et al. (2016a)
deﬁne one set of seed words for general sentiment analysis, a different set for Twitter,
and yet another set for sentiment in ﬁnancial text:
Domain Positive seeds Negative seeds
General good, lovely, excellent, fortunate, pleas-
ant, delightful, perfect, loved, love,
happybad, horrible, poor, unfortunate, un-
pleasant, disgusting, evil, hated, hate,
unhappy
Twitter love, loved, loves, awesome, nice,
amazing, best, fantastic, correct, happyhate, hated, hates, terrible, nasty, awful,
worst, horrible, wrong, sad
Finance successful, excellent, proﬁt, beneﬁcial,
improving, improved, success, gains,
positivenegligent, loss, volatile, wrong, losses,
damages, bad, litigation, failure, down,
negative
In the second step, we compute embeddings for each of the pole words. These
embeddings can be off-the-shelf word2vec embeddings, or can be computed directly

504 CHAPTER 22 • L EXICONS FOR SENTIMENT , AFFECT ,AND CONNOTATION
on a speciﬁc corpus (for example using a ﬁnancial corpus if a ﬁnance lexicon is the
goal), or we can ﬁnetune off-the-shelf embeddings to a corpus. Fine-tuning is espe-
cially important if we have a very speciﬁc genre of text but don’t have enough data
to train good embeddings. In ﬁnetuning, we begin with off-the-shelf embeddings
like word2vec, and continue training them on the small target corpus.
Once we have embeddings for each pole word, we create an embedding that
represents each pole by taking the centroid of the embeddings of each of the seed
words; recall that the centroid is the multidimensional version of the mean. Given
a set of embeddings for the positive seed words S+={E(w+
1),E(w+
2),...,E(w+
n)},
and embeddings for the negative seed words S−={E(w−
1),E(w−
2),...,E(w−
m)}, the
pole centroids are:
V+=1
nn∑
1E(w+
i)
V−=1
mm∑
1E(w−
i) (22.1)
The semantic axis deﬁned by the poles is computed just by subtracting the two vec-
tors:
Vaxis=V+−V−(22.2)
Vaxis, the semantic axis, is a vector in the direction of positive sentiment. Finally,
we compute (via cosine similarity) the angle between the vector in the direction of
positive sentiment and the direction of w’s embedding. A higher cosine means that
wis more aligned with S+than S−.
score(w) = cos(
E(w),Vaxis)
=E(w)·Vaxis
∥E(w)∥∥Vaxis∥(22.3)
If a dictionary of words with sentiment scores is sufﬁcient, we’re done! Or if we
need to group words into a positive and a negative lexicon, we can use a threshold
or other method to give us discrete lexicons.
22.4.2 Label Propagation
An alternative family of methods deﬁnes lexicons by propagating sentiment labels
on graphs, an idea suggested in early work by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown
(1997). We’ll describe the simple SentProp (Sentiment Propagation) algorithm of
Hamilton et al. (2016a), which has four steps:
1.Deﬁne a graph : Given word embeddings, build a weighted lexical graph by
connecting each word with its knearest neighbors (according to cosine simi-
larity). The weights of the edge between words wiandwjare set as:
Ei,j=arccos(
−wi⊤wj
∥wi∥∥wj∥)
. (22.4)
2.Deﬁne a seed set: Choose positive and negative seed words.
3.Propagate polarities from the seed set: Now we perform a random walk on
this graph, starting at the seed set. In a random walk, we start at a node and

22.4 • S EMI-SUPERVISED INDUCTION OF AFFECT LEXICONS 505
then choose a node to move to with probability proportional to the edge prob-
ability. A word’s polarity score for a seed set is proportional to the probability
of a random walk from the seed set landing on that word (Fig. 22.7).
4.Create word scores : We walk from both positive and negative seed sets,
resulting in positive (rawscore+(wi)) and negative (rawscore−(wi)) raw label
scores. We then combine these values into a positive-polarity score as:
score+(wi) =rawscore+(wi)
rawscore+(wi)+rawscore−(wi)(22.5)
It’s often helpful to standardize the scores to have zero mean and unit variance
within a corpus.
5.Assign conﬁdence to each score: Because sentiment scores are inﬂuenced by
the seed set, we’d like to know how much the score of a word would change if
a different seed set is used. We can use bootstrap sampling to get conﬁdence
regions, by computing the propagation Btimes over random subsets of the
positive and negative seed sets (for example using B=50 and choosing 7 of
the 10 seed words each time). The standard deviation of the bootstrap sampled
polarity scores gives a conﬁdence measure.

22.4.3 Other Methods
The core of semisupervised algorithms is the metric for measuring similarity with
the seed words. The Turney and Littman (2003) and Hamilton et al. (2016a) ap-
proaches above used embedding cosine as the distance metric: words were labeled
as positive basically if their embeddings had high cosines with positive seeds and
low cosines with negative seeds. Other methods have chosen other kinds of distance
metrics besides embedding cosine.
For example the Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) algorithm uses syntactic
cues; two adjectives are considered similar if they were frequently conjoined by and
and rarely conjoined by but. This is based on the intuition that adjectives conjoined
by the words andtend to have the same polarity; positive adjectives are generally
coordinated with positive, negative with negative:
fair and legitimate, corrupt and brutal
but less often positive adjectives coordinated with negative:
*fair and brutal, *corrupt and legitimate
By contrast, adjectives conjoined by butare likely to be of opposite polarity:

506 CHAPTER 22 • L EXICONS FOR SENTIMENT , AFFECT ,AND CONNOTATION
fair but brutal
Another cue to opposite polarity comes from morphological negation ( un-,im-,
-less). Adjectives with the same root but differing in a morphological negative ( ad-
equate/inadequate ,thoughtful/thoughtless ) tend to be of opposite polarity.
Yet another method for ﬁnding words that have a similar polarity to seed words
is to make use of a thesaurus like WordNet (Kim and Hovy 2004, Hu and Liu 2004).
A word’s synonyms presumably share its polarity while a word’s antonyms probably
have the opposite polarity. After a seed lexicon is built, each lexicon is updated as
follows, possibly iterated.
Lex+: Add synonyms of positive words ( well) and antonyms (like ﬁne) of negative
words
Lex−: Add synonyms of negative words ( awful ) and antonyms (like evil) of positive
words
An extension of this algorithm assigns polarity to WordNet senses, called Senti-
WordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). Fig. 22.8 shows some examples. SentiWordNet
Synset Pos Neg Obj
good#6 ‘agreeable or pleasing’ 1 0 0
respectable#2 honorable#4 good#4 estimable#2 ‘deserving of esteem’ 0.75 0 0.25
estimable#3 computable#1 ‘may be computed or estimated’ 0 0 1
sting#1 burn#4 bite#2 ‘cause a sharp or stinging pain’ 0 0.875 .125
acute#6 ‘of critical importance and consequence’ 0.625 0.125 .250
acute#4 ‘of an angle; less than 90 degrees’ 0 0 1
acute#1 ‘having or experiencing a rapid onset and short but severe course’ 0 0.5 0.5
Figure 22.8 Examples from SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et al., 2010). Note the differences between senses
of homonymous words: estimable#3 is purely objective, while estimable#2 is positive; acute can be positive
(acute#6 ), negative ( acute#1 ), or neutral ( acute #4 ).
In this algorithm, polarity is assigned to entire synsets rather than words. A
positive lexicon is built from all the synsets associated with 7 positive words, and a
negative lexicon from synsets associated with 7 negative words. A classiﬁer is then
trained from this data to take a WordNet gloss and decide if the sense being deﬁned
is positive, negative or neutral. A further step (involving a random-walk algorithm)
assigns a score to each WordNet synset for its degree of positivity, negativity, and
neutrality.
In summary, semisupervised algorithms use a human-deﬁned set of seed words
for the two poles of a dimension, and use similarity metrics like embedding cosine,
coordination, morphology, or thesaurus structure to score words by how similar they
are to the positive seeds and how dissimilar to the negative seeds.
22.5 Supervised Learning of Word Sentiment
Semi-supervised methods require only minimal human supervision (in the form of
seed sets). But sometimes a supervision signal exists in the world and can be made
use of. One such signal is the scores associated with online reviews .
The web contains an enormous number of online reviews for restaurants, movies,
books, or other products, each of which have the text of the review along with an

to 10. Fig. 22.9 shows samples extracted from restaurant, book, and movie reviews.
We can use this review score as supervision: positive words are more likely to
appear in 5-star reviews; negative words in 1-star reviews. And instead of just a
binary polarity, this kind of supervision allows us to assign a word a more complex
representation of its polarity: its distribution over stars (or other scores).
Thus in a ten-star system we could represent the sentiment of each word as a
10-tuple, each number a score representing the word’s association with that polarity
level. This association can be a raw count, or a likelihood P(w|c), or some other
function of the count, for each class cfrom 1 to 10.
For example, we could compute the IMDb likelihood of a word like disap-
point(ed/ing) occurring in a 1 star review by dividing the number of times disap-
point(ed/ing) occurs in 1-star reviews in the IMDb dataset (8,557) by the total num-
ber of words occurring in 1-star reviews (25,395,214), so the IMDb estimate of
P(disappointing|1)is .0003.
A slight modiﬁcation of this weighting, the normalized likelihood, can be used
as an illuminating visualization (Potts, 2011)1
P(w|c) =count (w,c)∑
w∈Ccount (w,c)
PottsScore (w) =P(w|c)∑
cP(w|c)(22.6)
Dividing the IMDb estimate P(disappointing|1)of .0003 by the sum of the likeli-
hood P(w|c)over all categories gives a Potts score of 0.10. The word disappointing
thus is associated with the vector [.10, .12, .14, .14, .13, .11, .08, .06, .06, .05]. The

Potts diagram (Potts, 2011) is a visualization of these word scores, representing the Potts diagram
prior sentiment of a word as a distribution over the rating categories.
Fig. 22.10 shows the Potts diagrams for 3 positive and 3 negative scalar adjec-
tives. Note that the curve for strongly positive scalars have the shape of the letter
J, while strongly negative scalars look like a reverse J. By contrast, weakly posi-
tive and negative scalars have a hump-shape, with the maximum either below the
mean (weakly negative words like disappointing ) or above the mean (weakly pos-
itive words like good ). These shapes offer an illuminating typology of affective
meaning.

ing the J-shape and reverse J-shape for strongly positive and negative adjectives, and the
hump-shape for more weakly polarized adjectives.
Fig. 22.11 shows the Potts diagrams for emphasizing and attenuating adverbs.
Note that emphatics tend to have a J-shape (most likely to occur in the most posi-
tive reviews) or a U-shape (most likely to occur in the strongly positive and nega-
tive). Attenuators all have the hump-shape, emphasizing the middle of the scale and
downplaying both extremes. The diagrams can be used both as a typology of lexical
sentiment, and also play a role in modeling sentiment compositionality.
In addition to functions like posterior P(c|w), likelihood P(w|c), or normalized
likelihood (Eq. 22.6) many other functions of the count of a word occurring with a
sentiment label have been used. We’ll introduce some of these on page 512, includ-
ing ideas like normalizing the counts per writer in Eq. 22.14.
22.5.1 Log Odds Ratio Informative Dirichlet Prior
One thing we often want to do with word polarity is to distinguish between words
that are more likely to be used in one category of texts than in another. We may, for
example, want to know the words most associated with 1 star reviews versus those
associated with 5 star reviews. These differences may not be just related to senti-
ment. We might want to ﬁnd words used more often by Democratic than Republican
members of Congress, or words used more often in menus of expensive restaurants

Given two classes of documents, to ﬁnd words more associated with one cate-
gory than another, we could measure the difference in frequencies (is a word wmore
frequent in class Aor class B?). Or instead of the difference in frequencies we could
compute the ratio of frequencies, or compute the log odds ratio (the log of the ratio
between the odds of the two words). We could then sort words by whichever associ-
ation measure we pick, ranging from words overrepresented in category Ato words
overrepresented in category B.
The problem with simple log-likelihood or log odds methods is that they overem-
phasize differences in very rare words, and often also in very frequent words. Very
rare words will seem to occur very differently in the two corpora since with tiny
counts there may be statistical ﬂuctuations, or even zero occurrences in one corpus
compared to non-zero occurrences in the other. Very frequent words will also seem
different since all counts are large.
In this section we walk through the details of one solution to this problem: the
“log odds ratio informative Dirichlet prior” method of Monroe et al. (2008) that is a
particularly useful method for ﬁnding words that are statistically overrepresented in
one particular category of texts compared to another. It’s based on the idea of using
another large corpus to get a prior estimate of what we expect the frequency of each
word to be.
Let’s start with the goal: assume we want to know whether the word horrible
occurs more in corpus ior corpus j. We could compute the log likelihood ratio ,log likelihood
ratio
using fi(w)to mean the frequency of word win corpus i, and nito mean the total
number of words in corpus i:
llr(horrible ) = logPi(horrible )
Pj(horrible )
=logPi(horrible )−logPj(horrible )
=logfi(horrible )
ni−logfj(horrible )
nj(22.7)
Instead, let’s compute the log odds ratio : does horrible have higher odds in ior in log odds ratio

ni−fi(horrible ))
−log(fj(horrible )
nj−fj(horrible ))
(22.8)
The Dirichlet intuition is to use a large background corpus to get a prior estimate of
what we expect the frequency of each word wto be. We’ll do this very simply by
adding the counts from that corpus to the numerator and denominator, so that we’re
essentially shrinking the counts toward that prior. It’s like asking how large are the
differences between iand jgiven what we would expect given their frequencies in
a well-estimated large background corpus.
The method estimates the difference between the frequency of word win two
corpora iandjvia the prior-modiﬁed log odds ratio for w,δ(i−j)
w, which is estimated
as:
δ(i−j)
w=log(fi
w+αw
ni+α0−(fiw+αw))
−log(
fj
w+αw
nj+α0−(fj
w+αw))
(22.9)
(where niis the size of corpus i,njis the size of corpus j,fi
wis the count of word
win corpus i,fj
wis the count of word win corpus j,α0is the scaled size of the
background corpus, and αwis the scaled count of word win the background corpus.)
In addition, Monroe et al. (2008) make use of an estimate for the variance of the
log–odds–ratio:
σ2(
ˆδ(i−j)
w)
≈1
fiw+αw+1
fj
w+αw(22.10)
The ﬁnal statistic for a word is then the z–score of its log–odds–ratio:
ˆδ(i−j)
w√
σ2(
ˆδ(i−j)
w)(22.11)
The Monroe et al. (2008) method thus modiﬁes the commonly used log odds ratio
in two ways: it uses the z-scores of the log odds ratio, which controls for the amount
of variance in a word’s frequency, and it uses counts from a background corpus to
provide a prior count for words.
Fig. 22.12 shows the method applied to a dataset of restaurant reviews from
Yelp, comparing the words used in 1-star reviews to the words used in 5-star reviews
(Jurafsky et al., 2014). The largest difference is in obvious sentiment words, with the
1-star reviews using negative sentiment words like worse, bad, awful and the 5-star
reviews using positive sentiment words like great, best, amazing . But there are other
illuminating differences. 1-star reviews use logical negation ( no, not ), while 5-star
reviews use emphatics and emphasize universality ( very, highly, every, always ). 1-
star reviews use ﬁrst person plurals ( we, us, our ) while 5 star reviews use the second
person. 1-star reviews talk about people ( manager, waiter, customer ) while 5-star
reviews talk about dessert and properties of expensive restaurants like courses and
atmosphere. See Jurafsky et al. (2014) for more details.

22.6 Using Lexicons for Sentiment Recognition
In Appendix K we introduced the naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis. The
lexicons we have focused on throughout the chapter so far can be used in a number
of ways to improve sentiment detection.
In the simplest case, lexicons can be used when we don’t have sufﬁcient training
data to build a supervised sentiment analyzer; it can often be expensive to have a
human assign sentiment to each document to train the supervised classiﬁer.
In such situations, lexicons can be used in a rule-based algorithm for classiﬁca-
tion. The simplest version is just to use the ratio of positive to negative words: if a
document has more positive than negative words (using the lexicon to decide the po-
larity of each word in the document), it is classiﬁed as positive. Often a threshold λ
is used, in which a document is classiﬁed as positive only if the ratio is greater than
λ. If the sentiment lexicon includes positive and negative weights for each word,
θ+
wandθ−
w, these can be used as well. Here’s a simple such sentiment algorithm:
f+=∑
ws.t.w∈positivelexiconθ+
wcount (w)
f−=∑
ws.t.w∈negativelexiconθ−
wcount (w)
sentiment =

+iff+
f−>λ
−iff−
f+>λ
0 otherwise.(22.12)
If supervised training data is available, these counts computed from sentiment lex-
icons, sometimes weighted or normalized in various ways, can also be used as fea-
tures in a classiﬁer along with other lexical or non-lexical features. We return to
such algorithms in Section 22.7.

512 CHAPTER 22 • L EXICONS FOR SENTIMENT , AFFECT ,AND CONNOTATION
22.7 Using Lexicons for Affect Recognition
Detection of emotion (and the other kinds of affective meaning described by Scherer
(2000)) can be done by generalizing the algorithms described above for detecting
sentiment.
The most common algorithms involve supervised classiﬁcation: a training set is
labeled for the affective meaning to be detected, and a classiﬁer is built using features
extracted from the training set. As with sentiment analysis, if the training set is large
enough, and the test set is sufﬁciently similar to the training set, simply using all the
words or all the bigrams as features in a powerful classiﬁer like logistic regression or
SVM is an excellent algorithm whose performance is hard to beat. Thus we can treat
affective meaning classiﬁcation of a text sample as simple document classiﬁcation.
Some modiﬁcations are nonetheless often necessary for very large datasets. For
example, the Schwartz et al. (2013) study of personality, gender, and age using 700
million words of Facebook posts used only a subset of the n-grams of lengths 1-
3. Only words and phrases used by at least 1% of the subjects were included as
features, and 2-grams and 3-grams were only kept if they had sufﬁciently high PMI
(PMI greater than 2 ∗length , where length is the number of words):
pmi(phrase ) =logp(phrase )∏
w∈phrasep(w)(22.13)
Various weights can be used for the features, including the raw count in the training
set, or some normalized probability or log probability. Schwartz et al. (2013), for
example, turn feature counts into phrase likelihoods by normalizing them by each
subject’s total word use.
p(phrase|subject ) =freq(phrase,subject )∑
phrase′∈vocab (subject )freq(phrase′,subject )(22.14)
If the training data is sparser, or not as similar to the test set, any of the lexicons
we’ve discussed can play a helpful role, either alone or in combination with all the
words and n-grams.
Many possible values can be used for lexicon features. The simplest is just an
indicator function, in which the value of a feature fLtakes the value 1 if a particular
text has any word from the relevant lexicon L. Using the notation of Appendix K, in
which a feature value is deﬁned for a particular output class cand document x.
fL(c,x) ={
1 if∃w:w∈L&w∈x&class =c
0 otherwise
Alternatively the value of a feature fLfor a particular lexicon Lcan be the total
number of word tokens in the document that occur in L:
fL=∑
w∈Lcount (w)
For lexica in which each word is associated with a score or weight, the count can be
multiplied by a weight θL
w:
fL=∑
w∈LθL
wcount (w)

22.8 • L EXICON -BASED METHODS FOR ENTITY -CENTRIC AFFECT 513
Counts can alternatively be logged or normalized per writer as in Eq. 22.14.
However they are deﬁned, these lexicon features are then used in a supervised
classiﬁer to predict the desired affective category for the text or document. Once
a classiﬁer is trained, we can examine which lexicon features are associated with
which classes. For a classiﬁer like logistic regression the feature weight gives an
indication of how associated the feature is with the class.
22.8 Lexicon-based methods for Entity-Centric Affect
What if we want to get an affect score not for an entire document, but for a particular
entity in the text? The entity-centric method of Field and Tsvetkov (2019) combines
affect lexicons with contextual embeddings to assign an affect score to an entity in
text. In the context of affect about people, they relabel the Valence/Arousal/Domi-
nance dimension as Sentiment/Agency/Power. The algorithm ﬁrst trains classiﬁers
to map embeddings to scores:
1. For each word win the training corpus:
(a) Use off-the-shelf pretrained encoders (like BERT) to extract a contextual
embedding efor each instance of the word. No additional ﬁnetuning is
done.
(b) Average over the eembeddings of each instance of wto obtain a single
embedding vector for one training point w.
(c) Use the NRC V AD Lexicon to get S, A, and P scores for w.
2. Train (three) regression models on all words wto predict V , A, D scores from
a word’s average embedding.
Now given an entity mention min a text, we assign affect scores as follows:
1. Use the same pretrained LM to get contextual embeddings for min context.
2. Feed this embedding through the 3 regression models to get S, A, P scores for
the entity.
This results in a (S,A,P) tuple for a given entity mention; To get scores for the rep-
resentation of an entity in a complete document, we can run coreference resolution
and average the (S,A,P) scores for all the mentions. Fig. 22.13 shows the scores
from their algorithm for characters from the movie The Dark Knight when run on
Wikipedia plot summary texts with gold coreference.
22.9 Connotation Frames
The lexicons we’ve described so far deﬁne a word as a point in affective space. A
connotation frame , by contrast, is a lexicon that incorporates a richer kind of gram-connotation
frame
matical structure, by combining affective lexicons with the frame semantic lexicons
of Chapter 21. The basic insight of connotation frame lexicons is that a predicate
like a verb expresses connotations about the verb’s arguments (Rashkin et al. 2016,
Rashkin et al. 2017).
Consider sentences like:

ment have resulted in his effective removal from
the industry. While articles about the #MeToo
movement portray men like Weinstein as unpow-
erful, we can speculate that the corpora used to
train ELMo and BERT portray them as powerful.
Thus, in a corpus where traditional power roles
have been inverted, the embeddings extracted
from ELMo and BERT perform worse than ran-
dom, as they are biased towards the power struc-
tures in the data they are trained on. Further ev-
idence of this exists in the performance of the
BERT-masked embeddings - whereas these em-
beddings generally capture power poorly as com-
pared to the unmasked embeddings (Table 2),
they outperform the unmasked embeddings on this
task, and even outperform the frequency baseline
in one setting. Nevertheless, they do not outper-
form Field et al. (2019 ), likely because they do not
capture affect information as well as the unmasked
embeddings (Table 2).
4.3 Qualitative Document-level Analysis
Finally, we qualitatively analyze how well our
method captures affect dimensions by analyzing
single documents in detail. We conduct this anal-
ysis in a domain where we expect entities to fulﬁll
traditional power roles and where entity portray-
als are known. Following Bamman et al. (2013 ),
we analyze the Wikipedia plot summary of the
movie The Dark Knight ,7focusing on Batman

To facil-itate extracting example sentences, we score eachinstance of these entities in the narrative separatelyand average across instances to obtain an entityscore for the document.9To maximize our databy capturing every mention of an entity, we per-form co-reference resolution by hand. Addition-ally, based on our results from Table3as well asthe use of Wikipedia data in training the ELMomodel (Peters et al.,2018), we use ELMo embed-dings for our analysis.Figures1and2show results. For refer-ence, we show the entity scores as compared toone polar opposite pair identiﬁed by ASP. Boththe regression model and ASP show similar pat-terns. Batman has high power, while Rachel haslow power. Additionally, the Joker is associatedwith the most negative sentiment, but the high-est agency. Throughout the plot summary, themovie progresses by the Joker taking an aggres-sive action and the other characters responding.We can see this dynamic reﬂected in the Joker’sproﬁle score, as a high-powered, high-agency,low-sentiment character, who is the primary plot-driver. In general, ASP shows a greater separationbetween characters than the regression model. Wehypothesize that this occurs because ASP isolatesthe dimensions of interest, while the regression ap-proach captures other confounds, such as that hu-9When we used this averaging metric in other evaluations,we found no signiﬁcant change in results. Thus, in other sce-narios, we compute scores over averaged embeddings, ratherthan averaging scores separately computed for each embed-ding to reduce computationally complexity.

(22.16) the teenager ... survived the Boston Marathon bombing”
By using the verb violate in (22.15), the author is expressing their sympathies with
Country B, portraying Country B as a victim, and expressing antagonism toward
the agent Country A. By contrast, in using the verb survive , the author of (22.16) is
expressing that the bombing is a negative experience, and the subject of the sentence,
the teenager, is a sympathetic character. These aspects of connotation are inherent
in the meaning of the verbs violate andsurvive , as shown in Fig. 22.14.

The connotation frame lexicons of Rashkin et al. (2016) and Rashkin et al.
(2017) also express other connotative aspects of the predicate toward each argu-
ment, including the effect (something bad happened to x) value : (x is valuable), and
mental state : (x is distressed by the event). Connotation frames can also mark the
power differential between the arguments (using the verb implore means that the
theme argument has greater power than the agent), and the agency of each argument
(waited is low agency). Fig. 22.15 shows a visualization from Sap et al. (2017).
Connotation frames can be built by hand (Sap et al., 2017), or they can be learned
by supervised learning (Rashkin et al., 2016), for example using hand-labeled train-

more, as will be seen in Section 4.1, connotation
frames offer new insights that complement and de-
viate from the well-known Bechdel test ( Bechdel ,
1986 ). In particular, we ﬁnd that high-agency
women through the lens of connotation frames are
rare in modern ﬁlms. It is, in part, because some
movies (e.g., Snow White) accidentally pass the
Bechdel test and also because even movies with
strong female characters are not entirely free from
the deeply ingrained biases in social norms.
2 Connotation Frames of Power and
Agency
We create two new connotation relations, power
andagency (examples in Figure 3), as an expan-
sion of the existing connotation frame lexicons.3
Three AMT crowdworkers annotated the verbs
with placeholders to avoid gender bias in the con-
text (e.g., Xrescued Y; an example task is shown
in the appendix in Figure 7). We deﬁne the anno-
tated constructs as follows:

thority levels of the agent and theme relative to

one another. For example, if the agent “dom-
inates” the theme (denoted as power (AG>TH)),
then the agent is implied to have a level of control
over the theme. Alternatively, if the agent “hon-
ors” the theme (denoted as power (AG<TH)), the
writer implies that the theme is more important or
authoritative. We used AMT crowdsourcing to la-
bel 1700 transitive verbs for power differentials.
With three annotators per verb, the inter-annotator
agreement is 0.34 (Krippendorff’s ↵).
Agency The agency attributed to the agent of the
verb denotes whether the action being described
implies that the agent is powerful, decisive, and
capable of pushing forward their own storyline.
For example, a person who is described as “ex-
periencing” things does not seem as active and de-
cisive as someone who is described as “determin-
ing” things. AMT workers labeled 2000 transi-
tive verbs for implying high/moderate/low agency
(inter-annotator agreement of 0.27). We denote
high agency as agency (AG)=+, and low agency
asagency (AG)= .
Pairwise agreements on a hard constraint are
56% and 51% for power and agency, respec-
tively. Despite this, agreements reach 96% and
94% when moderate labels are counted as agree-
ing with either high or low labels, showing that an-
notators rarely strongly disagree with one another.
Some contributing factors in the lower KA scores
include the subtlety of choosing between neutral

22.10 Summary
• Many kinds of affective states can be distinguished, including emotions ,moods ,
attitudes (which include sentiment ),interpersonal stance , and personality .
•Emotion can be represented by ﬁxed atomic units often called basic emo-
tions , or as points in space deﬁned by dimensions like valence andarousal .
• Words have connotational aspects related to these affective states, and this
connotational aspect of word meaning can be represented in lexicons.
• Affective lexicons can be built by hand, using crowd sourcing to label the
affective content of each word.
• Lexicons can be built with semi-supervised , bootstrapping from seed words
using similarity metrics like embedding cosine.
• Lexicons can be learned in a fully supervised manner, when a convenient
training signal can be found in the world, such as ratings assigned by users on
a review site.
• Words can be assigned weights in a lexicon by using various functions of word
counts in training texts, and ratio metrics like log odds ratio informative
Dirichlet prior .
• Affect can be detected, just like sentiment, by using standard supervised text
classiﬁcation techniques, using all the words or bigrams in a text as features.
Additional features can be drawn from counts of words in lexicons.
• Lexicons can also be used to detect affect in a rule-based classiﬁer by picking
the simple majority sentiment based on counts of words in each lexicon.
•Connotation frames express richer relations of affective meaning that a pred-
icate encodes about its arguments.

516 CHAPTER 22 • L EXICONS FOR SENTIMENT , AFFECT ,AND CONNOTATION
Historical Notes
The idea of formally representing the subjective meaning of words began with Os-
good et al. (1957), the same pioneering study that ﬁrst proposed the vector space
model of meaning described in Chapter 5. Osgood et al. (1957) had participants rate
words on various scales, and ran factor analysis on the ratings. The most signiﬁcant
factor they uncovered was the evaluative dimension, which distinguished between
pairs like good/bad ,valuable/worthless ,pleasant/unpleasant . This work inﬂuenced
the development of early dictionaries of sentiment and affective meaning in the ﬁeld
ofcontent analysis (Stone et al., 1966).
Wiebe (1994) began an inﬂuential line of work on detecting subjectivity in text, subjectivity
beginning with the task of identifying subjective sentences and the subjective char-
acters who are described in the text as holding private states, beliefs or attitudes.
Learned sentiment lexicons such as the polarity lexicons of Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown (1997) were shown to be a useful feature in subjectivity detection (Hatzi-
vassiloglou and Wiebe 2000, Wiebe 2000).
The term sentiment seems to have been introduced in 2001 by Das and Chen
(2001), to describe the task of measuring market sentiment by looking at the words in
stock trading message boards. In the same paper Das and Chen (2001) also proposed
the use of a sentiment lexicon. The list of words in the lexicon was created by
hand, but each word was assigned weights according to how much it discriminated
a particular class (say buy versus sell) by maximizing across-class variation and
minimizing within-class variation. The term sentiment , and the use of lexicons,
caught on quite quickly (e.g., inter alia, Turney 2002). Pang et al. (2002) ﬁrst showed
the power of using all the words without a sentiment lexicon; see also Wang and
Manning (2012).
Most of the semi-supervised methods we describe for extending sentiment dic-
tionaries drew on the early idea that synonyms and antonyms tend to co-occur in the
same sentence (Miller and Charles 1991, Justeson and Katz 1991, Riloff and Shep-
herd 1997). Other semi-supervised methods for learning cues to affective mean-
ing rely on information extraction techniques, like the AutoSlog pattern extractors
(Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). Graph based algorithms for sentiment were ﬁrst sug-
gested by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), and graph propagation became a
standard method (Zhu and Ghahramani 2002, Zhu et al. 2003, Zhou et al. 2004a,
Velikovich et al. 2010). Crowdsourcing can also be used to improve precision by
ﬁltering the result of semi-supervised lexicon learning (Riloff and Shepherd 1997,
Fast et al. 2016).
Much recent work focuses on ways to learn embeddings that directly encode sen-
timent or other properties, such as the D ENSIFIER algorithm of Rothe et al. (2016)
that learns to transform the embedding space to focus on sentiment (or other) infor-
mation.
