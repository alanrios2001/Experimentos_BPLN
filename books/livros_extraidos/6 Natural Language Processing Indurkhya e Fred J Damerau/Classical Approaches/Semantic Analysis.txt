5.1 Basic Concepts and Issues in Natural Language Semantics
In general linguistics, semantic analysis refers to analyzing the meanings of words, ﬁxed expressions,whole sentences, and utterances in context. In practice, this means translating original expressionsinto some kind of semantic metalanguage. The major theoretical issues in semantic analysis thereforeturn on the nature of the metalanguage or equivalent representational system (see Section 5.2). Manyapproaches under the inﬂuence of philosophical logic have restricted themselves to truth-conditionalmeaning, but such analyses are too narrow to enable a comprehensive account of ordinary languageuse or to enable many practically required applications, especially those involving human–computerinterfacing or naïve reasoning by ordinary users. Unfortunately, there is even less consensus in the ﬁeldoflinguisticsemanticsthaninothersubﬁeldsoflinguistics,suchassyntax,morphology,andphonology.NLP practitioners interested in semantic analysis nevertheless need to become familiar with standardconcepts and procedures in semantics and lexicology. The following is a tutorial introduction. It willprovide the reader with foundational knowledge on linguistic semantics. It is not intended to give anoverviewofapplicationswithincomputationallinguisticsortointroducehands-onmethods, butratheraimstoprovidebasictheoreticalbackgroundandreferencesnecessaryforfurtherstudy, aswellasthreecasestudies.
Thereisatraditionaldivisionmadebetweenlexicalsemantics,whichconcernsitselfwiththemeanings
of words and ﬁxed word combinations, and supralexical (combinational, or compositional) semantics,whichconcernsitselfwiththemeaningsoftheindeﬁnitelylargenumberofwordcombinations—phrasesand sentences—allowable under the grammar. While there is some obvious appeal and validity to thisdivision,itisincreasinglyrecognizedthatword-levelsemanticsandgrammaticalsemanticsinteractandinterpenetrate in various ways. Many linguists now prefer to speak of lexicogrammar, rather than tomaintainastrictlexicon-grammardistinction.Inpart,thisisbecauseitisevidentthatthecombinatorialpotentialofwordsislargelydeterminedbytheirmeanings,inpartbecauseitisclearthatmanygrammaticalconstructions have construction-speciﬁc meanings; for example, the construction to have a VP (to have
ad r i n k,as w i m, etc.) has meaning components additional to those belonging to the words involved
(Wierzbicka 1982; Goldberg 1995; Goddard 2000; Fried and Östman 2004). Despite the artiﬁciality ofrigidly separating lexical semantics from other domains of semantic analysis, lexical semantics remainsthe locus of many of the hard problems, especially in crosslinguistic contexts. Partly this is becauselexicalsemanticshasreceivedrelativelylittleattentioninsyntax-drivenmodelsoflanguageorinformal(logic-based)semantics.
It is widely recognized that the overriding problems in semantic analysis are how to avoid circularity
and how to avoid inﬁnite regress. Most approaches concur that the solution is to ground the analysis ina terminal set of primitive elements, but they diﬀer on the nature of the primitives (are they elementsof natural language or creations of the analyst? are they of a structural-procedural nature or moreencompassingthanthis?aretheylanguage-speciﬁcoruniversal?).Approachesalsodiﬀerontheextenttowhichtheyenvisagethatsemanticanalysiscanbepreciseandexhaustive(howﬁne-grainedcanoneexpecta semantic analysis to be? are semantic analyses expected to be complete or can they be underspeciﬁed?ifthelatter,howexactlyarethemissingdetailstobeﬁlledin?).
A major divide in semantic theory turns on the question of whether it is possible to draw a strict line
betweensemanticcontent,inthesenseofcontentencodedinthelexicogrammar,andgeneralencyclopedicknowledge.Whateverone’spositiononthisissue,itisuniversallyacknowledgedthatordinarylanguageuse involves a more or less seamless integration of linguistic knowledge, cultural conventions, andreal-worldknowledge.

OnefrequentlyidentiﬁedrequirementforsemanticanalysisinNLPgoesundertheheadingofambiguity
resolution.Fromamachinepointofview,manyhumanutterancesareopentomultipleinterpretations,because words may have more than one meaning (lexical ambiguity), or because certain words, such asquantiﬁers, modals, or negative operators may apply to diﬀerent stretches of text (scopal ambiguity), orbecause the intended reference of pronouns or other referring expressions may be unclear (referentialambiguity).
In relation to lexical ambiguities, it is usual to distinguish between homonymy (diﬀerent words with
the same form, either in sound or writing, for example, light(vs.dark)a n dlight (vs.heavy),sonand
sun, and polysemy (diﬀerent senses of the same word, for example, the several senses of the words hot
andsee).BothphenomenaareproblematicalforNLP,butpolysemyposesgreaterproblems,becausethe
meaning diﬀerences concerned, and the associated syntactic and other formal diﬀerences, are typicallymoresubtle.Mishandlingofpolysemyisacommonfailingofsemanticanalysis:boththepositingoffalsepolysemyandfailuretorecognizerealpolysemy(Wierzbicka1996:Chap.9;Goddard2000).Theformerproblemisverycommoninconventionaldictionaries,includingCollinsCobuildandLongman,andalsoin WordNet. The latter is more common in theoretical semantics, where theorists are often reluctant toface up to the complexities of lexical meanings.

5.2 Theories and Approaches to Semantic Representation
Varioustheoriesandapproachestosemanticrepresentationcanberoughlyrangedalongtwodimensions:(1) formal vs. cognitive and (2) compositional vs. lexical. Formal theories have been strongly advocatedsince the late 1960s (e.g., Montague 1973, 1974; Cann 1994; Lappin 1997; Portner and Partee 2002;Gutiérrez-Rexach 2003), while cognitive approaches have become popular in the last three decades(e.g., Fauconnier 1985; Johnson 1987; Lakoﬀ 1987; Langacker 1987, 1990, 1991; Jackendoﬀ 1990, 2002;Wierzbicka 1988, 1992, 1996; Talmy 2000; Geeraerts 2002; Croft and Cruse 2003; Cruse 2004), drivenalsobyinﬂuencesfromcognitivescienceandpsychology.Compositionalsemanticsisconcernedwiththebottom-upconstructionofmeaning,startingwiththelexicalitems,whosemeaningsaregenerallytreatedas given, that is, are left unanalyzed. Lexical semantics, on the other hand, aims at precisely analyzingthe meanings of lexical items, either by analyzing their internal structure and content (decompositionalapproaches)orbyrepresentingtheirrelationstootherelementsinthelexicon(relationalapproaches,seeSection5.3).
Thissectionsurveyssomeofthetheoriesandapproaches, thoughduetolimitationsofspacethiscan
only be done in a cursory fashion. Several approaches will have to remain unmentioned here, but theinterestedreader isreferred to theaccompanyingwiki for an expanded reading list. We will startwith aformal-compositionalapproachandmovetowardmorecognitive-lexicalapproaches.
5.2.1 Logical Approaches
Logical approaches to meaning generally address problems in compositionality, on the assumption (theso-called principleofcompositionality ,attributedtoFrege)thatthemeaningsofsupralexicalexpressions
aredeterminedbythemeaningsoftheirpartsandthewayinwhichthosepartsarecombined.
There is no universal logic that covers all aspects of linguistic meaning and characterizes all valid
arguments or relationships between the meanings of linguistic expressions (Gamut 1991 Vol. I: 7).DiﬀerentlogicalsystemshavebeenandarebeingdevelopedforlinguisticsemanticsandNLP.Themostwellknownandwidespreadispredicatelogic,inwhichpropertiesofsetsofobjectscanbeexpressedviapredicates,logicalconnectives, andquantiﬁers. Thisisdonebyprovidinga“syntax”(i.e., aspeciﬁcationhowtheelementsofthelogicallanguagecanbecombinedtoformwell-formedlogicalexpressions)anda

“semantics”(aninterpretationof thelogical expressions, aspeciﬁcationof whattheseexpressions meanwithinthelogicalsystem).Examplesofpredicatelogicrepresentationsaregivenin(1b)and(2b),whichrepresentthesemanticinterpretationormeaningofthesentencesin(1a)and(2a),respectively.Intheseformulae, x is a ‘variable,’ k a ‘term’ (denoting a particular object or entity), politician, mortal,like,
etc. are predicates (of diﬀerent arity), ∧,→are ‘connectives,’ and ∃,∀are the existential quantiﬁer and
universal quantiﬁer, respectively. Negation can also be expressed in predicate logic, using the symbol ¬
oravariant.
(1) a.Somepoliticiansaremortal .
b.∃x(politician(x) ∧mortal(x))
[Thereisanx(atleastone)sothatxisapoliticianandxismortal.]
(2) a.AllAustralianstudentslikeKevinRudd.
b.∀x((student(x) ∧Australian(x)) →like(x,k))
[ForallxwithxbeingastudentandAustralian,xlikesKevinRudd.]
Notice that, as mentioned, there is no analysis of the meanings of the predicates, which correspond tothe lexical items in the original sentences, for example, politician, mortal, student , etc. Notice also the
“constructed”andsomewhatartiﬁcialsounding characteroftheexamplesentencesconcerned, whichistypicalofmuchworkinthelogicaltradition.
Predicate logic also includes a speciﬁcation of valid conclusions or inferences that can be drawn: a
prooftheorycomprisesinferenceruleswhoseoperationdetermineswhichsentencesmustbetruegiventhat some other sentences are true (Poesio 2000). The best known example of such an inference rule istheruleof modusponens:IfPisthecaseandP →Qisthecase,thenQisthecase(cf.(3)):
(3) a. Modusponens:
(i) P(premise)
(ii) P →Q(premise)
(iii) Q(conclusion)
b. (i)Conradistired (P:tired(c))
(ii)WheneverConradistired,hesleeps (P:tired(c),Q: sleep(c),P →Q)
(iii)Conradsleeps (Q:sleep(c))
Intheinterpretationofsentencesinformalsemantics,themeaningofasentenceisoftenequatedwithitstruth conditions, that is, the conditions under which the sentence is true. This has led to an applicationof model theory (Dowty et al. 1981) to natural language semantics. The logical language is interpretedinawaythatforthelogicalstatementsgeneraltruthconditionsareformulated,whichresultinconcretetruth values under concrete models (or possible worlds). An alternative approach to truth-conditionalandpossibleworldsemanticsissituationsemantics(BarwiseandPerry1983),inwhichsituationsratherthantruthvaluesareassignedtosentencesasreferents.
Although sometimes presented as a general-purpose theory of knowledge, predicate logic is not
powerful enough to represent the intricacies of semantic meaning and is fundamentally diﬀerent fromhuman reasoning (Poesio 2000). It has nevertheless found application in logic programming, whichin turn has been successfully applied in linguistic semantics (e.g., Lambalgen and Hamm 2005). Fordetailedintroductionstologicformalisms,includinglambdacalculusandtypedlogicalapproaches,

5.2.2 Discourse Representation Theory
Discourserepresentationtheory(DRT)wasdevelopedintheearly1980sbyKamp(1981)(cf.KampandReyle 1993; Blackburn and Bos 1999; van Eijck 2006; Geurts and Beaver 2008) in order to capture thesemantics of discourses or texts, that is, coherent sequences of sentences or utterances, as opposed toisolated sentences or utterances. The basic idea is that as a discourse or text unfolds the hearer buildsup a mental representation (represented by a so-called discourse representation structure, DRS), andthateveryincomingsentencepromptsadditionstothisrepresentation.Itisthusadynamicapproachtonaturallanguagesemantics(asitisinthesimilar,independentlydevelopedFileChangeSemantics(Heim1982,1983)).

As (4) shows, a DRS is presented in a graphical format, as a rectangle with twocompartments.Thediscoursereferentsarelistedintheuppercompartmentandtheconditionsaregivenin the lower compartment. The two discourse referents in the example (x and y) denote am a nandhe,
respectively.Intheexample, amanandheareanaphoricallylinkedthroughtheconditiony =x,thatis,

Recursiveness is an important feature. DRSs can comprise conditions that contain other DRSs. Anexample is given in (5). Notice that according to native speaker intuition this sequence is anomalous:thoughonthefaceofit everyman isasingularnoun-phrase,thepronoun hecannotreferbacktoit.
(5)Everymansleeps.Hesnores .

man(x)⇒sleep(x)

snore(y)
In the DRT representation, the quantiﬁcation in the ﬁrst sentence of (5) results in an if-then condition:if x is a man, then x sleeps. This condition is expressed through a conditional (A⇒B)involving two
DRSs.Thisresultsinxbeingdeclaredatalowerlevelthany,namely,inthenestedDRSthatispartofthe

conditional, which means that x is not an accessible discourse referent for y, and hence that every man
cannotbeanantecedentfor he,incorrespondencewithnativespeakerintuition.
The DRT approach is well suited to dealing with indeﬁnite noun phrases (and the question of when
to introduce a new discourse referent, cf. also Karttunen 1976), presupposition, quantiﬁcation, tense,and anaphora resolution. Discourse Representation Theory is thus seen as having “enabled perspicuoustreatments of a range of natural language phenomena that have proved recalcitrant over many years”(Geurts and Beaver 2008) to formal approaches. In addition, inference systems have been developed(Saurer1993; Kampand Reyle1996)andimplementationsemploying Prolog (BlackburnandBos 1999,2005). Extensions of DRT have also been developed. For the purposes of NLP, the most relevant isSegmentedDiscourseRepresentationTheory(SDRT;Asher1993;AsherandLascarides2003).Itcombinesthe insights of DRT and dynamic semantics on anaphora with a theory of discourse structure in whicheachclauseplaysoneormorerhetoricalfunctionswithinthediscourseandentertainsrhetoricalrelationstootherclauses,suchas“explanation,”“elaboration,”“narration,”and“contrast.”
5.2.3 Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon
Another dynamic view of semantics, but focusing on lexical items, is Pustejovsky’s (1991a,b, 1995,2001) Generative Lexicon theory. He states: “our aim is to provide an adequate description of how ourlanguage expressions have content, and how this content appears to undergo continuous modiﬁcationandmodulationinnewcontexts”(Pustejovsky2001:52).
Pustejovsky posits that within particular contexts, lexical items assume diﬀerent senses. For example,
theadjective goodisunderstooddiﬀerentlyinthefollowingfourcontexts:(a) agoodumbrella (anumbrella
thatguardswellagainstrain),(b) agoodmeal (amealthatisdeliciousornourishing),(c) agoodteacher
(ateacherwhoeducateswell), (d) a good movie (amovie thatisentertainingor thoughtprovoking). He
develops“theideaofalexiconinwhichsenses[ofwords/lexicalitems,CG/AS]incontextcanbeﬂexiblyderivedonthebasisofarichmultilevelrepresentationandgenerativedevices”(Behrens1998:108).Thislexicon is characterized as a computational system, with the multilevel representation involving at leastthefollowingfourlevels(Pustejovsky1995:61):
1.Argument structure: Speciﬁcation of number and type of logical arguments and how they arerealizedsyntactically.
2.Event structure : Deﬁnition of the event type of a lexical item and a phrase. The event type sorts
includestates,processes,andtransitions;sub-eventstructuringispossible.
3.Qualia structure : Modes of explanation, comprising qualia (singular: quale) of four kinds: consti-
tutive(what an object is made of), formal(what an object is—that which distinguishes it within a
larger domain), telic(what the purpose or function of an object is), and agentive(how the object
cameintobeing,factorsinvolvedinitsoriginorcomingabout).
4.LexicalInheritanceStructure :Identiﬁcationofhowalexicalstructureisrelatedtootherstructures
inthelexiconanditscontributiontotheglobalorganizationofalexicon.
The multilevel representation is given in a structure similar to HPSG structures (Head Driven PhraseStructureGrammar;PollardandSag1994).AnexampleofthelexicalrepresentationfortheEnglishverbbuildisgiveninFigure5.1(Pustejovsky1995:82).
The event structure shows that buildis analyzed as involving a process (e
1)followed by a resultant
state(e2)andorderedbytherelation“exhaustiveorderedpartof (<α).”Theheadoftheeventstructure,
and hence foregrounded, is the process e 1. The argument structure lists three arguments—two true
arguments (ARG1,ARG2)that are syntactically realized parameters of the lexical item build(Johnbuilt
ahouse),andonedefaultargument (D-ARG1),aparameterthatparticipatesintheexpressionofthequalia
but is not necessarily expressed syntactically ( John built a house outofbricks ). For the arguments, their
characteristicsarebeingnotedinthattheirontologicalrestrictionandqualiaarelisted: ARG1,forinstance,
is restricted to arguments that are animate individuals and of a physical nature, while ARG2is—also a
physical object—an artifact and made out of D-ARG1(as the cross-reference via the boxed number ‘3’

cf. Zaeﬀerer 2002), and that what is created comes about by a build_act—a process (e1)performed by
ARG1(‘1’)andusing D-ARG1(‘3’).Theresultisthe existresultantstate (e2)ofARG2.Noticethatexpressions

The generative devices in Pustejovsky’s system connect the levels of representation with the aim of
providing the compositional interpretation of the lexical elements in context. They include those listed
below (Pustejovsky 1995: 61–62). For further details and a formalization of the generative devices, see
Pustejovsky(1995,esp.Chap.7).
1.Typecoercion : Alexicallygovernedtypeshifting; asemanticoperationthatconvertsanargument
to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error
(Pustejovsky1995:111).Forexample,if wantisassumedtohaveapropositionasanargument,the
non-propositional argument a beerinMary wants a beer is coerced into a propositional type (on
thebasisofthetelicqualeof beerdrinking ); hence,Marywantsabeer amountsto‘Marywantsto
drinkabeer.’
2.Selective binding : A lexical item operates speciﬁcally on the substructure of a phrase, without
changingtheoveralltypeinthecomposition—anadjectivecanmodifyaparticularaspectofnoun

3.Co-composition : Multiple elements within a phrase behave as functors, generating new non-
lexicalized senses for the words in composition—the argument qualia structure can modify the
semantictypeofthepredicate.Forexample, bakeisgenerallyanalyzedashavingachangeofstate
meaning (as in bake potatoes ), but inbake a cake , the meaning of the predicate bakeis modiﬁed
into a creation meaning. This is because the agentive quale of the cake “makes reference to the
very process within which it is embedded in this phrase” (Pustejovsky 1995: 123), namely, the
baking.

5.2.4 Natural Semantic Metalanguage
Natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) is a decompositional system based on empirically establishedsemanticprimes,thatis,simpleindeﬁnablemeaningswhichappeartobepresentasword-meaningsinalllanguages(Wierzbicka1996;Goddard1998;GoddardandWierzbicka2002;Peeters2006;Goddard2008).The NSM system uses a metalanguage, which is essentially a standardized subset of natural language: asmall subset of word-meanings (63 in number, see Table 5.1), together with a subset of their associatedsyntactic(combinatorial)properties.Table5.1ispresentedinitsEnglishversion,butcomparabletablesofsemanticprimeshavebeendrawnupformanylanguages, includingRussian, French, Spanish, Chinese,Japanese, Korean, and Malay. Semantic primes and their grammar are claimed to represent a kind of“intersection”ofalllanguages.

The formal mode of meaning representation in the NSM approach is the semantic explication. This

A simple example of an NSM explication is given in [A] for the English verb to break, in one of its
several senses. The explication applies only to the sense of the word found in examples like to break a
stick(an egg, a lightbulb, a vase, a model plane ). Its successive components indicate action, concurrent
eﬀect, aspect, and a result (‘this thing was not one thing anymore’); the ﬁnal “subjective” componentindicatesthattheresultisseenasirreversible.Interestingly,manylanguages—includingChinese,Malay,andLao—lackacomparablybroadverbthatsubsumesmanydiﬀerentmannersof“breaking”(MajidandBowerman2007).

The concept of semantic molecules leads to new ways of understanding semantic complexity in the
lexicon, quite diﬀerent to anything envisaged in other cognitive or generative approaches to lexicalsemantics, and very diﬀerent to structuralist and logic-based approaches. Many lexical semantic struc-tures appear to have a kind of “gangly and lumpy” quality—lengthy strings of simple semantic primesinterspersedwithsemanticallydensemolecules(forexamples,seeSection5.4).Semanticmoleculesenableagreatcompressionofsemanticcomplexity,butatthesametimethiscomplexityisdisguisedbyitsbeingencapsulatedandtelescopedintolexicalunitsembeddedoneintheother,likeasetofRussiandolls.
5.2.5 Object-Oriented Semantics
Object-oriented semantics is a new ﬁeld in linguistic semantics. Although it is rather restricted inits semantic application domains so far—mainly applied to the representation of verbal meaning—itpromisestobecomerelevantforNLPapplicationsinthefuture,andduetothelargebodyofresearchincomputerscienceawealthofresourcesisalreadyavailableforobject-orientedsystemsingeneral.ThereissomeoverlapwithPustejovsky’sideas,ashehimselfobserves:
When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument structure of a verb, we beginto see a richer notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-orientedapproachestoprogramming.(Pustejovsky1991a:427)
The basic motive behind deploying the computational object-oriented paradigm to linguistic semanticsis,however,itsintuitiveaccessibility.Thehumancognitivesystemcentersaroundentitiesandwhattheyarelike,howtheyarerelatedtoeachother,whathappenstothemandwhattheydo,andhowtheyinteractwith one another. This corresponds to the object-oriented approach, in which the concept of “object”is central, whose characteristics, relations to other entities, behavior, and interactions are modeled ina rigorous way. This correspondence between object-orientation and cognitive organization stronglysuggeststheapplicationofobject-orientationfortherepresentationaltaskathand.
Schalley (2004a,b) introduces a decompositional representational framework for verbal semantics,
the Uniﬁed Eventity Representation (UER). It is based on the Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML; cf.ObjectManagementGroup1997–2009),thestandardformalismforobject-orientedsoftwaredesignandanalysis. The UER adopts the graphical nature of the UML as well as the UML’s general architecture.UERdiagramsarecomposedofwell-deﬁnedgraphicalmodelingelementsthatrepresentconceptualcate-gories.Conceptualcontainments,attachments,andrelationsarethusexpressedbygraphicalentailments,attachments,andrelations.
The lexical representation is much more detailed than in the Generative Lexicon, and the graphical
modelingelementshighlighttheinternalstructureofverbalmeaning.AnexampleisgiveninFigure5.2(Schalley2004b:787).
The modeling of the transitive wake up(as inMary woke up her husband ), dubbed wake_up_2in
Figure 5.2, contains a detailed modeling of the “static structure” of verbal meaning (primarily of theparticipantsinthewakeupeventity,theircharacteristics,androles)andofthe“dynamicstructure”(whatishappeningtotheparticipantsinthewakeupeventity?whichstatesandtransitionsdotheparticipantsundergo? how do they interact?).

expected to reﬂect this perfectly. While the modeling of lexical meaning is a task for the type level, the

5.3 Relational Issues in Lexical Semantics
Linguistic expressions are not isolated, but are interrelated in many ways. In this section, we focus on
relationalissuesinlexicalsemantics.
5.3.1 Sense Relations and Ontologies
Sense relations—semantic relations between lexical elements—form the basis for word nets, such as the
electroniclexicaldatabaseWordNet(Fellbaum1998a,b)andsimilarapproachesforlanguagesotherthan
English, for example, the multilingual lexical database EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998, 2001). The large

document structuring and categorization (cf., e.g., Fellbaum 1998b; Morato et al. 2004; Huang et al. in
press), to mention a few—show that there is a high demand for information on lexical relations and
linguistically informed ontologies. Although a rather new ﬁeld, the interface between ontologies and
linguisticstructureisbecomingavibrantandinﬂuentialareainknowledge representationandNLP(cf.

onresourcesandtools,seeHuangetal.(inpress).
Sense relations can be seen as revelatory of the semantic structure of the lexicon. There are both
horizontal and vertical sense relations. Horizontal relations include synonymy (sameness of meaning
of diﬀerent linguistic forms, such as OrangeandApfelsine in German—both meaning ‘orange’) and
various relations that can be subsumed under the general notion of opposition (Cruse 1986). These
include incompatibility (mutually exclusive in a particular context, e.g., ﬁn—foot), antonymy (gradable,
directionallyopposed,e.g., big—small ),complementarity(exhaustivedivisionofconceptualdomaininto
mutually exclusive compartments, e.g., aunt—uncle, possible—impossible ), conversity (static directional
opposites: speciﬁcation of one lexical element in relation to another along some axis, for example,above—below ), and reversity (dynamic directional opposites: motion or change in opposite ways, e.g.,
ascend—descend ).
The two principal vertical relations are hyponymy and meronymy. Hyponymy is when the meaning
of one lexical element, the hyponym, is more speciﬁc than the meaning of the other, the hyperonym(e.g.,dog—animal ).Itisoftenassumedthathyponymycorrespondstoataxonomic(kindof)relationship,
but this assumption is incorrect (see Section 5.4.3). Lexical items that are hyponyms of the same lexicalelement and belong to the same level in the structure are called co-hyponyms (dog ,cat,horseare co-
hyponymsof animal).Meronymyiswhenthemeaningofonelexicalelementspeciﬁesthatitsreferentis

An example is the concept PUT, for which there is no German lexical coding. Instead, Germanusesstellen,setzen,legen,stecken,whichallinvolveanactordisplayingabehaviorthatcausesanexponent
to move into a goal location (Er stellte das Buch ins Regal ‘He put the book on the shelf’). But they all
includeadditionalinformationontheorientationorpositionofthemotionexponentinthegoallocation:upright(stellen ),sitting(setzen),horizontal( legen),orpartiallyﬁttingintoanaperture( stecken).Although
the respective concepts are all subordinate concepts of PUT and they thus all entertain an ontologicalrelation to PUT, there are no sense relations in German corresponding to these ontological relations, asthereisnolexicalitemavailabletoexpressthesuperordinateconceptPUT.Unfortunately,thedistinctionbetweenlexicalandontologicalrelationsisoftennotclearlydrawn,neitherinlinguisticsnorinNLPandAI. The most obvious case in point is that WordNet, which was devised as a lexical resource and builton the basis of sense relations, is often treated and discussed as if it were an ontology at the same time(Fellbaum2007:420).
Ontologies—particularly upper-level and domain ontologies—have been developed and employed in
AI and knowledge representation (e.g., Sowa 2000), and more generally in computer science, for sometime. In computational linguistics, there is accordingly a branch which systematically takes advantage

of ontologies in the AI sense (also see Chapter 24). One of the most extensive works in this area isNirenburg and Raskin’s (2004) Ontological Semantics. Their ontology lists deﬁnitions of concepts for

andoneonomasticonareneededforeachlanguage);
•knowledge representation languages for specifying meaning structures, ontologies, and
lexicons;and
•asetofprocessingmodules,attheleast,asemantic analyzer andasemantic textgenerator.
(NirenburgandRaskin2004:10)
In linguistics proper, ontology-based approaches are only just becoming an explicit focus of research.In addition to ontological relations underlying sense relations and hence impacting on lexical struc-ture, it has recently been recognized that there are many more areas of semantic research that need totake language ontologies into account. Several examples, including lexical semantics, classiﬁers, wordclasses, anaphora resolution, and the grammar of coordination, can be found in Nickles et al. (2007:37–38).
5.3.2 Roles
Whileontologicalrelationsarestableconceptualrelations,therearealsosituation-speciﬁcrelations.Forexample, an instance of an eventity such as German setzen über (‘cross a waterbody,’ ‘leap across an

What aretheydeployingtodoso?Whatisimportantintherelationalcontextisthatsuchparticipantspeciﬁcationsinclude the role they play in the eventity they partake in. In semantics, these roles are referred to assemantic roles, thematic roles, or predicate-argument relations (Van Valin 2004). Semantic roles areimportant for the linking of the arguments to their syntactic realizations (e.g., a patient participant isrealizedinEnglishasadirectobjectofanactivevoicesentence), inadditiontotheirvalueindescribingandrepresentingsemantics.Wewillnotfocusonthelinkingofargumentsinthefollowing,theinterestedreadermaywanttoconsult,forinstance,Dowty(1991),Goldberg(1995),VanValinandLaPolla(1997),VanValin(1999),andBowermanandBrown(2008).
Thenumberanddeﬁnitionofsemanticrolesarestillsubjecttocontroversialdiscussions.Initiatedby
Gruber (1965) and Fillmore (1968), there have been two opposing trends in linguistics with regard tosemantic roles. Localistic approaches, descending from Gruber, work with a small number of concrete,spatial relationships, such as goalandsource, which they see as the foundation for other, more abstract
roles. For example, an experiencer, intentional agent, or originating location would all be assigned thesource role. Non-localistic approaches, descending from Fillmore, work with a much larger number ofroles,whichcanbetailoredtospeciﬁcverbalsubclasses.TheFrameNetproject(Ruppenhoferetal.2006),

Furthermore, althoughasetofprototypicalrolenotionsseemsdesirable, suchalistwouldnotsuﬃce

involves an agent (the wilful purposive instigator), an instrument (the entity manipulated by the agentto carry out the action), and a location or ground (the place or locus where the leaping or crossingoccurs).

Another approach that considers semantic roles not to be independent entities is Jackendoﬀ’s (1990,2002) Conceptual Semantics. Jackendoﬀ (1990: 127) explicitly identiﬁes semantic roles as the argumentslotsofabstractbasicpredicates.

For speakers of English, states of mind like ‘feeling sad’ and ‘feeling unhappy’ may seem so natural thatone could assume they would have matching words in all languages, but this is very far from being thecase.

the laws of nature, the inevitability of ageing and death, etc. Choulacks this existential gravitas and is
a more common everyday word than bei,b u tchouis at least as close to English worried,a si ti st osad.
Chouis focused on the experiencer’s present situation. One experiences this feeling when confronting
a personal predicament that is forced on one by the circumstances, “leaving the experiencer caught ina dilemma—wanting to overcome a diﬃcult situation, yet not ﬁnding a solution” (Ye 2001: 379). Theexperiencer,moreover,cannotstopthinkingaboutit,creatingalinkwithEnglish preoccupied.Ye(2001)

5.4.2 Ethnogeographical Categories: “Rivers” and “Creeks”
Words for landforms and landscape features—like English desert,mountain,a n d river—might seem an

hill,riverandstream,lakeandpond). Languages diﬀer considerably in the nature of the distinctions
they recognize (Burenhult and Levinson 2008). Sometimes these diﬀerences are related to the nature ofthe landforms themselves, but categorization of the landscape also has a human dimension. It reﬂectsanthropocentricconcerns,andtheseconcernscanvarywiththecultureaswellaswiththephysicalworld.
The problem has been noted by researchers in geospatial data information systems, as well as by
geographers and linguists (Mark and Turk 2003, 2004). Some have called for the creation of a new ﬁeldof study into naïve geography: “a set of theories that provide the basis for designing future geographicinformation systems (GIS) that follow human intuition and are, therefore, easily accessible to a largerange of users” (Egenhofer and Mark 1995). From a computational point of view, questions like thefollowing arise (Scharl 2007; Oosterom and Zlatanova 2008; Stock 2008): What is the optimal ontologyforgeospatialdatabases?Whatsetofplacecategoriesorsemanticdescriptionsshouldbeusedtoannotateand index them?

Functional macro-category words, also called collective nouns (e.g., Mihatsch 2007), pose interestingsemanticchallengesinthemselves,notleastbecausetheytendtovaryacrosslanguagestoamuchgreaterextent than do true taxonomic words. In addition, their semantics have a direct relevance to the archi-tecture of semantic networks: semantic networks are typically organized in a hierarchical fashion, withclassiﬁcatory relationships indicated by the “is-a” relation, which is often assumed to correspond essen-tiallyto‘isakindof.’Higherlevelnodesaretypicallylabeledindiﬀerentlywitheithertaxonomicorwithfunctionalmacro-categorywords. Toputitanotherway, the“is-a”relationshipsometimescorrespondsto a genuine taxonomic one and sometimes does not, leading to inconsistent results and mismatcheswith the intuitions of ordinary speakers (Brachman 1983; cf. Wisniewski et al. 1996; Cruse 2002; VeresandSampson2005).Inthissection,wewillconcentrateonEnglishanddiscussthesemanticdiﬀerencesbetweenthreetypesofclassiﬁcatoryrelationshipsthatcanbeexempliﬁedasshowninTable5.3.

Therelationshipsillustratedintheleft-handcolumnofTable5.3aregenuinelytaxonomic.Forexample,
birdsare‘livingthingsofonekind’andthiskindisunderstoodtohavevarioussub-kinds. Themeaning
of the words sparrow,wren,a n deagle, for example, all contain the semantic molecule ‘bird [ M].’ The
relationships exempliﬁed in the other two columns are quite diﬀerent, both semantically and in theirgrammatical behavior. Though words like vegetables andfurniture may express classiﬁcation in a broad
sense,itisnotintermsofataxonomichierarchy.Wordslike vegetables, herbs,cosmetics,furniture, cutlery,
andjewelrydo not designate ‘things of one kind,’ but ‘things of many kinds’ uniﬁed by factors such as
shared functions, contiguity, and similar origins (Wierzbicka 1985, esp. Chap. 4, pp. 258–354; Goddard2009).
∗
“Plural-mostly” functional macro-category words (e.g., vegetables, cosmetics,herbs,cereals,drugs)
are so called because they occur predominantly in the plural, other than when they are bare stems incompounds, for example, vegetable soup ,cosmetic surgery. Singular occurrences are mostly in predicate
positionwiththeindeﬁnitearticle a,inagenericconstruction,forexample, Spinachisagreenvegetable ;
whilesingularswiththedeﬁnitearticlearerareandanomalous(? thevegetable, ?thecosmetic ).Theirmost
distinctivesemanticpropertyisthatwhencountingthereferentsof “plural-mostly”functionalcategories,such as vegetables, cosmetics, etc., one counts not individual items but kinds. For example, There were
onlytwovegetablesontheplate means‘onlyvegetablesoftwokinds.’
A semantic explication for vegetables is given in [I]. As mentioned, it begins with the component
‘thingsofmanykinds.’Component(b)isanexemplarcomponent,mentioningseveralofthemostsalientkinds (cf. Battig and Montague 1969; Rosch 1973; Rosch et al. 1976), which, needless to say, are highlyculture-speciﬁc. Component (c) sets out the salient properties shared by the various kinds, presentednotasinherentpropertiesbutintermsofhowpeoplethinkaboutthem—asedibleitemsrequiringsomepreparation(cooking, peeling, washing, etc.), thatcomefromthingsthatpeoplecultivateandthatgrowclosetotheground.Theyarenot(thoughtofas)sweet.Component(d)saysthatthesesharedconstrualsallow people to see things of these diﬀerent kinds as ‘like things of one kind.’ This makes the macro-category“quasi-taxonomic.”Thesemanticstructureofother“plural-mostly”macro-categorywords,suchasherbs,cereals,cosmetics,anddrugs followthesamebasictemplate.

Singular-only functional-collective category words (e.g., furniture, cutlery,clothing,crockery, jewelry)
are invariably singular in form (∗furnitures,∗clothings, etc.), but, unlike normal singular nouns, they
cannottakeanindeﬁnitesingulararticleortheword one(∗a/onefurniture,∗a/oneclothing ).Adistinctive
propertyisthattheyaregenerallycompatiblewiththe item(s)ofX orpiece(s)ofX construction.Although
grammatically singular, these nouns can be objects of verbs that imply a multiplex object, for example,laying out the cutlery ,re-arranging the furniture, sorting through the clothing . Many are compatible with
∗Thesourceoftheconfusionisnodoubttheassumptionthatsetinclusion(areferential,extensionalistrelationship)equates
to a ‘kind of’ relationship (an intensional, conceptual relationship), but this assumption is ﬂawed. Every policeman, forexample, is somebody’s son, but it doesn’t follow that a policeman is conceptualized as a ‘kind of son’ (Wierzbicka 1985:259).

phraseslike acollectionofX, arangeofX orasetofX.Wordslike furniture, cutlery,clothing,crockery,and
the like, tend to imply “unity of place,” that is, they designate things of diﬀerent kinds that are expectedtobeusedinheterogeneousgroupsofitemsallputinthesameplace.

Ifthesemanticanalysesin[I]and[J]arecorrectintheirmainoutlines, inordertobefaithfultohumancognitive organization, it is problematical to use functional macro-categories as higher level nodes insemantic networks, as if they were taxonomic categories. They could be more appropriately used asattribute features, though it has to be borne in mind that such categories are highly variable acrosslanguages.
5.5 Prospectus and “Hard Problems”
Despite declining “syntacticocentrism” (Jackendoﬀ 2002: 107–111), semantics—especially lexicalsemantics—remains the poor cousin of linguistics. There are relatively few specialists, especially withadditionalcrosslinguisticorNLPexpertise.
Thecomplexityoflexicalsemanticsandtheextentoflexical-semanticdiﬀerencesacrosslanguageshave
been vastly underestimated by most NLP practitioners and, for that matter, by most linguists. To someextent, this underestimation is due to the tendency of twentieth century work to concentrate on truth-conditionalandreferentialistapproachestomeaning.Thoughthereareinfactconsiderabledivergencesbetweenlanguagesinwordsthatrefertoconcretephysicalphenomena(includingbiologicalspecies),theextent of diﬀerences is much greater in relation to more cultural, more subjective words—words whosemeaningsare,sotospeak,creaturesofthemind.Suchmeaningsarecrucialtoordinarysocialcognitionand to ordinary language use and interpretation. To mention two more categories, there are culture-speciﬁc social ideals, such as Japanese waand Chinese xiào, usually clumsily rendered into English as
“unity,harmony”andas“ﬁlialpiety,”respectively(Ho1996;Wierzbicka1997:248–254;Goddard2005:84–88); and there are culture-speciﬁc social categories, such as English friend, Russian drug‘trusted
friend,’ Chinese zìjˇırén‘insider, one of us’ and wàirén‘outsider’ (Wierzbicka 1997: 32–84; Ye 2004).

114 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
Another signiﬁcant problem are abstract nouns such as English rights,security,dialogue,trauma,a n d
experience ,whichlackexactequivalentsinmanyoftheworld’slanguages(Wierzbicka2006,2009b).
Despite the tremendous advances in computational power and improvements in corpus linguistics,
theprospectusisnotparticularlygoodfornext-generationNLPapplicationsthatwoulddependonhigh-detailsemanticanalysis;forexample,ininformationextractionfromunstructuredtext(seeChapter21),machine translation, and the Semantic Web. Many common semantic phenomena are likely to remaincomputationallyintractablefortheforeseeablefuture.Rough-and-readysemanticprocessing(partialtextunderstanding),especiallyinrestricteddomainsand/orinrestricted“sublanguages”oﬀermorepromisingprospectsbutwehavetoberealisticaboutwhatisachievable,evenwithnext-generationtechnologies.
AparticularproblemisthatstandardresourcessuchasWordNetandGlobalWordNetcannotsupport
ﬁne-grained semantic analysis even for English, let alone for other major languages of the world. MajorcontrolledvocabularydictionariessuchasCollinsCobuildhavetheiruses,buttheytooarenotadequateto the task (Hoelter 1999; Guenthner 2008). Though corpus techniques and other computational toolsareprovidingvaluablenewresourcesandheuristics, therearenoquickandeasyautomaticmethodsforgenerating detailed lexical-semantic analyses. They must be hand built by experienced human analystsand it will be a long time before even a decent fragment of “ordinary English” (to speak with Montague1973)hasbeenadequatelyanalyzed.
It might be a practical proposition to specify moderately sized controlled auxiliary languages, such
as, in the case of English, Formalized English and Frame-CG (cf. Martin 2002) or an improved “Glo-bish” (Nerrière 2004), and to hand build complete semantically analyzed lexicogrammars for them. Butsuch auxiliary languages would be radically constrained compared with their ordinary unconstrainedcounterparts.
Above all, if progress is to be made, researchers in NLP and linguistic semantics must give serious
considerationtothequestionofstandards,whichplayaprominentroleincomputerscience.Itwouldnotbepossible,orevendesirable,tostandardizeworkingmethodsamongallthemultifariousresearchgroupsandcommunitiesinvolved,butthereneedstobesomecollectiveattentiontotheproblemofensuringthelongevity and comparability of research results and interoperability of systems.
