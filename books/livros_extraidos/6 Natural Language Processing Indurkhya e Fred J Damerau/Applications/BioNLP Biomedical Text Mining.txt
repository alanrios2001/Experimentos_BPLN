25.2 The Two Basic Domains of BioNLP: Medical and Biological
There are two basic user communities for BioNLP, and many diﬀerent user types within those twocommunities. The two main communities are the clinical or medical community on the one hand, andthe biological community on the other. (Additionally, there is much interest in the use of BioNLP for“translational research”—using basic biological research to inform clinical practice—but the two-waydistinctionmostlyholds.)
25.2.1 Medical/Clinical NLP
Within the medical community, there are widely diverse user types. Clinicians are providers of medicalcare. They have many questions to ask over the course of a typical workday (Ely et al. 2000), theyhave very little time to answer them, and they are not necessarily sophisticated searchers (Hersh et al.1999).Consumers,orpatients,presentadiﬀerentsetofchallenges.Theymaybesophisticatedsearchers,but are typically not equipped to comprehend the vast body of publicly available biomedical literature.“Informationists” are professional information retrieval specialists. They typically have a library sciencebackground, and may work in a library or directly with a clinical team. Finally, hospital administratorshavetocopewithtasksthatcanbeaidedbyNLP,rangingfrombillingtointernalprocessqualityassurance.
25.2.2 Biological/Genomic NLP
Within the biological community, there is an equivalently wide range of user types. They include high-throughputexperimentalists,benchscientists,andmodelorganismdatabasecurators.Wewillreturntotheselaterinthischapter.
Although there is a long history of research in clinical NLP, most BioNLP work in recent years has
focussed on the biological domain. This is probably due to a fundamental diﬀerence in the two ﬁelds:biologically oriented texts are massively and freely available, while clinical data has been prohibitivelydiﬃcult to obtain, and only recently has a free, publicly available collection of patient records becomeavailable(Pestianetal.2007).Althoughwewilldiscussmedicallanguageprocessingwhenapplicable,themajorityofthischapterwillfocusonbiological,primarilygenomic,NLP.25.2.2.1 High-Throughput Data InterpretationOneusertypewithinthebiologicalcommunityisthehigh-throughputexperimentalist.Thepastdecadehasseenaradicalshiftinthewaythatmolecularbiologistsdoscience.Where15yearsagoascientistmighthave been familiar with half a dozen proteins and would have been familiar with experimental methodsthatlethimorhergetdataononeproteinatatime,todaythereareassaysavailablethatmakeitpossibleto get data on as many as 30,000 genes in 12 subjects at a time at an economical and rapidly falling cost(under$500forthebasicmaterialsatthetimeofwriting).Thisﬂoodofdatahasrequiredthedevelopmentofwholenewwaysofdoingbiologicalscience.Forexample,familiarstatisticsarenotapplicablewhenthismanycross-comparisonsarepossible,necessitatingthedevelopmentofwaysofapplyingnonparametricsigniﬁcance tests to biological data. In addition, these high-throughput methodologies have led to atremendous increase in our knowledge about genes, causing an exponential growth in the number ofbiomedical publications in recent years (Hunter and Cohen 2006). For example, it used to be thoughtthat about 50 genes were involved in sporulation in yeast, one of the classic model organisms—through

BioNLP:BiomedicalTextMining 607
high-throughput assays, we now know from a single experiment of 500 genes that are involved in thisfundamentalprocess(Shatkayetal.2000,citingChuetal.1998).

One example of the latter type of system is MedMiner (Tanabe et al. 1999). This system does a setof literature searches for a list of genes combined with diﬀerent keywords related to particular themesthat are known to be salient in a molecular biologist’s mental model of the domain and, for each gene,returnstheresultsgroupedaccordingtothecategoryofkeywordsthatretrievedit. Asimilarsystemhasbeenbuiltforresearchersonthegeneticsofalcoholism,basedonadiﬀerentmentalmodel.
Anotherapproachistolookforprominentthemesinthepublicationsaboutthegenesinthelist.This
approach contrasts with the more common approach of clustering genes and assuming that clusteredgenes share similar functions. Shatkay et al. (2000) describe one such approach. It centers on theintuition that documents that are about genes with similar functions will be associated with similar setsofdocuments.Thus,itisdocument-centric,ratherthangene-centric.Themethodreliesonthereexistingonerepresentativedocumentforeverygenethatistobeanalyzed.Foreachrepresentativedocument,theprobabilisticalgorithmretrievesasetofsimilardocuments.Geneswhosedocumentsleadtotheretrievalofsimilarsetsofdocumentsarethenassumedtosharesimilarfunctions.Intheinterpretivestep,aBernoulliprocessisusedtogeneratealistoftermsthatrepresentsthethemesofeachsharedsetofdocuments.
A very diﬀerent approach to applying text mining to the high throughput data problem is to use

25.2.3 Model Organism Databases, and the Database Curator
as a Canonical User
Although high throughput experimentation and phenomenon-based database construction are bothpossibleusecasesforBioNLP,themostextensivelyexploredusecasehasbeenmodelorganismdatabaseconstruction.

608 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
“Model organisms” are species that are used as experimental surrogates for humans. They are of
importance to biomedical research because we share most of our genes with most living species, andbecause we cannot experiment on humans. A variety of common model organisms exist, with variousexperimental advantages to each. For example, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is useful for
studying cellular diﬀerentiation because the typical mature adult only has 959 cells, and the lineage ofeachoneisknown.
One of the fundamental enabling tools of modern genomic science has been the construction of
databases containing information about all or most of the genes in various model organisms (andhumans). To see a typical database entry for a gene, go to the Mouse Genome Informatics databaseat www.informatics.jax.org and search for brca1. The entry for this gene includes a unique identiﬁer
(MGI:104537) that is used as a primary key in the database, but rarely appears in free text. It alsoincludesanoﬃcialname
∗forthegene—breast cancer 1—andanoﬃcialsymbol: Brca1. (Aswillbeseen
in Section 25.4.2, the term “oﬃcial” is something of a misnomer.) The wide range of types of data thatareincludedinthedatabaseentryfor Brca1includephenotypes(physicalandbehavioralcharacteristics)

25.2.4 BioNLP in the Context of Natural Language Processing and

1. A variety of lexical resources. Some of these are smaller, on the order of 20,000 concepts, but
have been extensively crafted and reworked by entire communities of researchers, so that theyare essentially free of individual idiosyncracies of representation and have been carefully vettedfor errors of all sorts. The Gene Ontology is an example of such a resource (The Gene OntologyConsortium 2000). Other resources are less carefully constructed but are exceptionally large andhavebothbroadcoverageandsomeassociatedtools.AnexampleofsucharesourceistheUniﬁedMedical Language System (UMLS) (Lindberg et al. 1993), which currently comprises 900,000conceptswith2,000,000namesand12millionrelationsbetweenthoseconcepts.

3. A wide variety of annotated corpora and classiﬁed document collections. Corpora and document
collectionsareavailablewithbothlinguisticannotations—sentenceboundaries,tokenization,part
of speech, word senses, coreference, etc.—and semantic annotations, such as named entities and
relations. The majority of these are publicly available at no cost. Some of the more famous ones,
includingGENIAandtheBioCreativegenemention(GM)corpus,arediscussedbelow.
4. A wide variety of domain-specialized tools, including sentence segmenters, tokenizers (a notori-
ously diﬃcult task for biomedical text), named entity recognition systems, and semantic concept
normalizers.
As will be seen, the biomedical domain diﬀers from newswire text on practically every level, ranging
fromtokenizationtonamedentityrecognitiontocorpusconstructiontosemanticrepresentation.Solving
these problems for biomedical text has the potential to feed advances back to the newswire domain that
canpushworkinthatareaforward,aswell.
Beyond these reasons, BioNLP oﬀers the researcher an opportunity to make a clear contribution to
relievingthepreventablepainandsuﬀeringofhisorherfellowhumans.Thisisnotsomethingfoundin
mostareasofNLP.

25.4 Biomedical Text Mining
25.4.1 Named Entity Recognition

Despite the availability of a number of training corpora and two shared tasks focusing onthisproblem,performanceforbiomedicalNERhaslaggedbehindthatforthetraditionalMUCcategoriesofPERSON,LOCATION,andORGANIZATION—thehighest-performingsystemintheBioCreativeIInamedentityrecognitiontaskachievedanF-measureofonly0.87,andevenacombinedsystemassembledbytheorganizersachievedanF-measureofonly0.9066.Thereissomeevidencethatthisisduetolengthdiﬀerences between gene names and the traditional MUC categories (Yeh et al. 2005). There may alsohavebeeninconsistenciesinlabelingearlytrainingdatasets.
The most common named entity that is targetted by biomedical NER systems is the gene or protein
name. (Genesandproteinsareverydistinctbiologicalentities, butinpracticethereisoftennopracticalproblem with lumping them together for NER applications. Genes and proteins are related biologicallyinthatthepurposeofgenesistoholdthegeneticcodeforproteins,andinthegenomicliteraturethereisfrequentmetonymy,withgenenamesbeingusedtorefertothecorrespondingproteinandproteinnamesbeingusedtorefertothecorrespondinggene. Typically, thoughnotalways, ageneandtheproteinthatitencodeshavethesamename.InthecontextofNER,Iwillusetheterm“gene”torefertoageneanditscorrespondingproducts.)
Names of genes have the unusual characteristic that any gene typically has two things that count as
names for NER purposes. One of these is the gene name per se. The other is a shorter form, known asits gene symbol. The mouse gene breast cancer 1 and its symbol Brca1mentioned earlier are a typical

BioNLP:BiomedicalTextMining 611
example. From an NER perspective these are equivalent. It is often the case that both will appear in thesamedocument.Oftenthe“full”nameisusedontheﬁrstoccurrence,alongwithanappositionedsymbolin parentheses, and then subsequently the symbol is used. (This pattern is often exploited by good NERsystemstodisambiguategenesymbols.)
The form of gene names can vary widely depending on the community that studies the particular
organism in which a gene was ﬁrst discovered or is currently being studied. Mouse and human genesare often named by their function. For example, a typical human gene name would be melanocortin 1
receptor(GeneID 4157). This gene has the same name in the mouse (GeneID 17199). The community
ofDrosophila melanogaster (fruit ﬂy) researchers has a very diﬀerent tradition in naming genes. They
originally named genes by the physical appearance of ﬂies when the gene in question is mutated. Forexample, the ﬁrst gene discovered in D. melanogaster was named white(symbolw)b e c a u s eﬂ i e sh a v e

One of the ﬁrst papers in the modern genomic BioNLP era (Fukuda et al. 1998) was on a gene name
NERsystem.Itisdiscussedbelow.Inrecentyears,researchongeneNERhastakenplaceprimarilywithinasharedtaskcalledBioCreativeorsubsequenttoitusingtheBioCreativedata.InBioCreative,geneNERwas called the GM task, and we will refer to it in that way from here on. As noted above, one possiblesource of the lag in performance on GM as opposed to NER for the MUC categories has been lack ofconsistency in labeling gene names in training data sets. This lack of consistency has been seen in twoareas:decidingwhatcountsasamentionofageneoraprotein(e.g.,shouldrelatedgeneproducts,suchasRNAs, be included in thecategory?), and deciding whatcounts asthe borders of aGM. For example,given a string like human leptin receptor gene (PMID 9537324), should humanbe included in the text
span of the gene name? Should the word genebe included? Diﬀerent annotation projects have come up
with diﬀerent answers to these questions, and some projects have applied their rules inconsistently inthis area. The BioCreative organizers have attempted to give the annotation process a principled way ofdealing with these varying interpretations by developing gold standards that allow for variant forms, sothathumanleptinreceptorgene, humanleptinreceptor,and leptinreceptorgene mightallcountascorrect
systemoutputs.
One interesting result of the BioCreative GM evaluations has been the ﬁnding that enhancing a rule-

25.4.2 Named Entity Normalization
OneoftheuniquebutimportantproblemsingenomicBioNLPoverthepastfewyearshasbeenwhatis
knownasthegenenormalizationproblem. Genenormalization(GN)isthetaskofrelatingmentionsof
a gene name in text to some speciﬁc gene in a database of genes. Work on the GM task has long tended
todeﬁnetheproblemassimplyﬁndingtheboundariesandclassesofgenenamesintext.However,such
text spans are of little use in some (but not all) practical applications, where the more pressing need
is to determine exactly which gene in the set of genes in some organism that text string refers to. One
of the problems is massive ambiguity, both of names and symbols, although perhaps more so in the
case of symbols. A perhaps larger issue is that authors exercise no notion of a standard gene name or
symbol; diﬀerent communities may have diﬀerent names for the same gene, and authors may make up
ad hoc symbols. The Brca1gene, for instance, has been referred to in print by at least seven diﬀerent
symbols— IRIS,PSCP,BRCAI,BRCC1,RNF53,BROVA1,andBrca1.Onlytheyeastcommunityhasbeen
anexceptiontothis.
GN can be thought of as occupying a midpoint on the continuum between targetted word sense
disambiguation,whichitisnot,andall-wordswordsensedisambiguation;thetaskistodisambiguateall
genenames,butonlyallgenenames.
As an example, consider TRP1. Just within humans alone, this can refer to ﬁve diﬀerent genes. The
names of four of them are transient receptor potential channel 1 (GeneID 7220), transfer RNA proline 1
(GeneID7217), transformation-relatedprotein2 [sic](GeneID5903),and trypsinogen1 (GeneID5644).
This symbol also illustrates the hazards of ignoring minor typographical diﬀerences: if you search the
Entrez Gene database (see below under Resources) for TRP-1(with a hyphen), you get just a single

BioNLP:BiomedicalTextMining 613
hit—tyrosinase-related protein 1 (GeneID 7306), the ﬁfth human gene that shares this symbol and one
that is not retrieved if the search is done without the hyphen. It bears emphasizing that in naturally
occurringtexts,anyoftheseﬁvegenesmaybereferredtobythesymbolwith(TRP-1)orwithout(TRP1)
thehyphen,aswellaswithaspacebeforethenumeral(TRP1),andwithanycombinationoflettercases,
e.g.,TRP1,Trp1,trp1,TRP-1,Trp-1,etc.Furthermore,thesamekindsofvariabilitycanexistforthefull
name, so that for the gene with ID 5903 one may see transformation-related protein 1 ,transformation
relatedprotein1 ,transformation-relatedprotein-1 ,TransformationRelatedProtein1 ,etc.
TheBioCreativesharedtasks—anMUC-likeevaluationofBioNLP—hasthusfaralwaysincludedaGN
task, and the BioCreative deﬁnition of the task has had great inﬂuence. As deﬁned by BioCreative, the
input is an abstract of a journal article, and the output is a list of unique identiﬁers of genes mentioned
inthetext. Thismeans thatsystemsmust be ableto bothrecognize when two gene mentions in thetext

which minimally diﬀering pairs of gene names or symbols indicated “phonemic” diﬀerences, this paper
looked at hyphenation, letter case, parenthesized material, and edge eﬀects, ﬁnding that (despite the
diﬃcult examples shown in this chapter) hyphenation, case, and parenthesized material could generally
be safely normalized. Subsequent work on the problem of GN in text has tended to assume the ﬁndings

Oneareainwhichconsiderableprogresshasbeenachievedishandlingabbreviationsinbiomedicaltext.This is important in part because abbreviations are extremely common in biomedical text, with onestudy ﬁnding that 22% of biomedical abbreviations are ambiguous and that there are an average of 4.61deﬁnitions per abbreviation (Chang et al. 2002). The “one domain, one sense” assumption deﬁnitelydoesnothold.Anexampleistheabbreviation PDAincardiologytexts.Justwithincardiology,ithastwo

Abbreviation handling has been found useful in multiple applications. One is GN; the ability to map
a gene symbol, which is analogous to an abbreviation, to its full form is invaluable in GN, with thesymbol deﬁnition being used to decide which of two potential database entries a particular mention intextcorrespondsto(seeGN,above).
Two families of approaches to abbreviation-handling in biomedical text exist: statistical approaches,
andrule-basedones.Badstatisticalapproachestrainaclassiﬁerforeveryabbreviationthattheycanﬁndand then run it for any abbreviations that they have seen before. These approaches suﬀer both froma strong reliance on the availability of training data and from their limitation to being usable only forpreviously seen abbreviations; this is a problem because novel abbreviations are constantly publishedon an ad hoc basis.

25.5 Getting Up to Speed: Ten Papers and Resources That Will
Let You Read Most Other Work in BioNLP
There are about 10 papers and resources that, if you are familiar with them, will allow you to catchthe references in many publications in the BioNLP ﬁeld. They are reviewed brieﬂy here. These papers,supplementedbythelatestBioCreativepublications,willserveasanadequateintroductiontotheﬁeldofBioNLP,particularlyfromthegenomicsperspective.
25.5.1 Named Entity Recognition 1: KeX
Fukuda et al. (1998) is the ﬁrst named entity recognition paper of the modern era in BioNLP. It was aruled-basedsystem.Itsapproachwassimple:
1. Findastringoftextthatlookslikeasymbolforayeastgene(e.g., ABC1)
2. Extendthenametotheleft(e.g., yeastABC1)
3. Extendthenametotheright(e.g., ABC1protein)
Thepaperreportedan F-measureinthe90s.Thisresulthasneverbeenreplicated.Partofthereported
success may be due to the fact that the system was evaluated on documents about yeast; yeast genes areespecially easy to recognize in text. The yeast community is the only one in which editors have insistedthat authors adhere to a speciﬁc nomenclature for referring to genes, and they always make use of asymbol,whichishighlyrestrictedwithrespecttoitspossibleshape.
25.5.2 Named Entity Recognition 2: Collier, Nobata, and GENIA
Nobataetal. (1999)andCollieretal. (2000)weretheﬁrstpaperstodescribelearning-basedapproachestoGMNER.TheycomparedNaiveBayes,decisiontrees,andHMM-basedsolutions.Nobataetal.(1999)made innovative use of a gazetteer, using it to derive a list of words that, when they appear as headnounsinaputativeentityname,arestrongindicatorsthatthecandidateis,infact,anamedentity.Thesenouns included words like protein, antigen, promoter, motif,a n d mRNA. The work was also notable for
the complexity of the ontology of named entity types that it assumed; in this case, the system targettedfour classes that have been found to be very diﬃcult even for humans to diﬀerentiate (Hatzivassiloglouet al. 2001): source, protein, DNA, and RNA. Collier et al. (2000) experimented with using an HMMto identify biologically relevant classes of named entities. The work was notable for the large number ofsemantic classes that it attempted to identify—10, which was much more than the MUC classes; for thelargenumberoffeaturesthatitfoundtoberelevantforthebiologicaldomain,manyofwhichhavebeenadopted by subsequent researchers in this area; and for the high performance that it achieved with onlya small amount of training data. These papers set the stage for a considerable amount of later work onmachine-learning-basedapproachestobiological/genomicnamedentityrecognition.

25.5.3 Information Extraction 1: Blaschke et al. (1999)
Blaschke et al. (1999) is the canonical paper on rule-based information extraction systems in BioNLP,particularly for extracting information about protein–protein interactions. The system described in thepaper was unusual in that it had no linguistic processing per se—not even part of speech tagging. Thesystem assumed manual GM NER and centered around a number of keywords that indicate protein–protein interactions. It then used distance between protein names (since the task is PPI and the targetwas network reconstruction) as an absolute ﬁlter, with pairs whose names were more than a maximumthresholdofwordsapartbeingdiscarded.Thesystemwasevaluatedonasetoftextfragmentsthatbetweenthem allowed the reconstruction of a particular signaling pathway if all interacting pairs were correctlyextracted.(Thisdatasethassincebeenconvertedintoacorpuswithstandoﬀannotation—(Johnsonetal.2007a).)Besidesbeingtheﬁrstpaperonarule-basedsystemforthisdomain,thispaperwasimportantinthatitshowedwhatcouldbeaccomplishedinthelimitingcaseofaninformationextractionsystemthatworkedpurelyonthebasisofsurfacelexicalfeatures,withnolinguisticinformationperseusedatall.

The second step of the system was to use a naive Bayes classiﬁer to classify sentencesthat contained two entities as to whether or not they actually posited a relation between them. Thefeatureswereabagofwords. Besidesbeingtheﬁrstpaperonlearning-basedapproachestoinformationextraction in this domain, the paper was also important in that it described a methodology for using“weakly labeled” training data; rather than constructing a manually judged gold standard data set, theauthors reverse-engineered what is still the largest set of biomedical training data of its kind from threedatabases.
25.5.5 Information Extraction 3: MedLEE, BioMedLEE, and GENIES
Finally, the set of information extraction tools based on the MedLEE system (Friedman 2000) roundsoutthewell-knownBioNLPIEtools.AnearlyclinicalinformationextractionsystemcalledMedLEEwasextended to produce theBioMedLEE and GENIES systems(Friedman et al. 2001). Theselatterversionswere meant to operate in the genomics domain. They used an unusual approach to GM named entityrecognition (since abandoned) in which they mapped the input text and a set of all known gene namesto faux amino acid sequences and then applied the BLAST algorithm to locate stretches of text in theinput that had a high likelihood of being gene names.

25.5.6 Corpora 1: PubMed/MEDLINE
PubMed/MEDLINE is the primary source for input documents in genomic BioNLP. It is not a corpus,norevenreallyatextcollection,sinceitisnotstatic,butrathergrows.(Infact,itisgrowingexponentially,as demonstrated by Hunter and Cohen (2006).)

PubMed is the search engine interface to MEDLINE. It returns documents in reverse

order ofpublication date; thishasoften beenquestioned bynatural languageprocessing specialists, andthere have been attempts to popularize versions of PubMed with relevance ranking. Other alternativeinterfaces to MEDLINE include GoPubMed, a search application that returns a set of Gene Ontologyannotations for each abstract (Doms and Schroeder 2005), and the FABLE system (Fang et al. 2006),whichisoptimizedforsearchesonhumangenes.(Theunusualnamingcharacteristicsofgenes,describedabove, can make searches for them diﬃcult, and there is no easy way to limit literature searches to aspeciﬁcspecies.)
AllPubMed/MEDLINEcontentsareinASCIIandareavailableforfree.ForseriousBioNLPresearch,
it is useful to maintain a local copy to avoid the considerable latency associated with frequent down-loads (as well as National Library of Medicine limitations on how often their servers can be hit). Acode base for maintaining a local copy in a relational database is available from the BioText project athttp://biotext.berkeley.edu/software.html.
25.5.7 Corpora 2: GENIA
ThemostinﬂuentialtruecorpusinthelinguisticsenseofthatwordisknownasGENIA(Ohtaetal.2002;Kimetal.2003;Erjavecetal.2003).Itisafullyannotatedcorpus,containingbothlinguisticandsemanticmark-ups. It contains 2,000 abstracts and 432,560 words of text. It is currently annotated with sentenceboundaries, token boundaries, part of speech, and named entities, and part of the corpus has beentreebanked. Future versions will include event annotation and coreference. GENIA has demonstrablybeen the most heavily used corpus in BioNLP (Cohen et al. 2005). It is freely distributed at the GENIAproject Web site. In recent years, another linguistically and semantically annotated corpus, known asPennBioIE, has become publicly available. It has already seen some use in linguistic and text processingworks (Cohen et al. 2008b), although unlike GENIA, it is not freely available and it remains to be seenwhatitsimpactwillbe.
25.5.8 Lexical Resources 1: The Gene Ontology
TheGeneOntologyisathree-partontologythatwasoriginallybuilt(andisstillmaintained)bybiologistsfor classifying the function of genes. The three parts of the ontology are concerned with molecularfunctions(e.g., chaperoneregulatoractivity ),biologicalprocesses(e.g., establishmentoflocalization ),and
cellularcomponents.Thebasicbuildingblocksoftheontologyaretermsandtheirassociateddeﬁnitions;these are linked to each other by the two relations is-a and part-of. The current version of the ontologycontains about 23,000 concepts (versus the 147,000 in WordNet). Although the Gene Ontology is aninterestinglinguisticartifactandassuchhasbeenthesubjectofdescriptiveworkthathashadanimpacton the maintenance of the ontology itself (Ogren et al. 2004, 2005; Mungall 2004), the Gene Ontologyhas been used less as a lexical resource than as a target for language processing applications. The GOhas been used extensively by biologists to annotate genes in biological databases (see above on modelorganism databases), and a considerable amount of text mining work has had the goal of automaticallyassigningGeneOntologyclassestogenes(knowninthebiologicalcurationworldas“annotation”)basedon textual inputs. The task is quite diﬃcult, being complicated by a variety of factors that includes thenecessityofbeingabletocarryoutgoodGN,thenormaldiﬃcultiespresentinanyinformationextractiontask (where in this case relations must be found between genes and Gene Ontology concepts), and thevery large diﬃculty in recognizing Gene Ontology terms in text themselves—typical leaf nodes includeacyl binding, ﬂagellin-based ﬂagellum basal body ,structural constituent of cytoskeleton, cell growth,a n d

Many aspects of Entrez Gene entrieshave been used or targetted in BioNLP. For the GN task, Entrez Gene entries are the targetted databaseidentiﬁer.ItssummariesofgenefunctionwereusedtogreatsuccessbySehgalandSrinivasan(2006)inagenesymboldisambiguationtaskinaninformationretrievalcontext.GeneReferencesIntoFunctionareshort,<255 character statements about the functions of a gene, broadly construed.

Note that commas sometimes indicate word-boundaries and sometimes do not, and that the crucial
conjunct is a word subsegment that is not separated either by whitespace or by a hyphen from the lastconjunctprecedingit,i.e., benzaldehyde in4-(4-formyl-4
′-methyldiphenyl-amino)benzaldehyde .
A number of NER systems perform their own tokenization step, and those may be adequate for
later processing needs. A system that works well for chemical names such as the diﬃcult cases shownhere is the OSCAR3 system (Corbett et al. 2007), available via an API. The KeX system’s tokenizergenerally works well, and is useful for Perl-based processing. For building one’s own pipeline, theLingPipeAPIisincreasinglypopular.(LingPipealsoprovidesasentencesegmenterthatisoptimizedforPubMed/MEDLINE text.) Jiang and Zhai (2007) provide a tokenizer that is optimized for the needs ofinformationretrieval.

25.6.4 Full Parsers
Full parsers that are optimized for biomedical text have only recently become available. Many of theproblems that are pervasive when dealing with biomedical text raise their heads in the area of parsing.Tokenization is an obvious one—even shallow parsers often fail on the tokenization issues that comeup in this domain. Another is the paradox that parsing is helpful for named entity recognition, but it isuseful to do named entity recognition before parsing to avoid needless parsing of full gene names, suchasbreastcancerassociated1 . Variouspapershavelookedattheeﬀectivenessofoﬀ-the-shelfparsersand
their default models for biomedical text (Clegg and Shepherd 2005, 2007). Optimized parsers are now

available, including the Enju structural parser with a GENIA-trained model (Miyao and Tsujii 2008).Pyysaloetal.havemadeagenomicsdependencyparseravailable(Pyysaloetal.2006).
25.7 Special Considerations in BioNLP
Compared to many other application areas, and to academic NLP in general, BioNLP carries with it anunusual opportunity and an unusual burden. Much of the impetus for research in this area comes fromtheusersthemselves,andwell-madeBioNLPapplicationsdoactuallygetused.But,apoorlybuiltBioNLPapplicationcannotbereliedontodonomoreharmthanamissedwebpagefromanInternetsearchorabad classiﬁcation: a poor application may have harmful consequences for real people with real diseases.Therefore,goodsoftwareengineeringpracticesareanessentialpartofthepracticeofBioNLP.
25.7.1 Code Coverage, Testing, and Corpora
The BioNLP community diﬀers from the mainstream NLP community in that many of its softwareproductsaredevelopedwiththestatedgoalofprovidingsolutionstoresearchersandclinicalpersonnel,rather than necessarily advancing the state of theoretical knowledge in NLP or linguistics. This brings aspecialburdentoexercisegoodsoftwareengineeringpractices,andinparticulartodoindustrial-qualitysoftware testing. Unfortunately, this has not necessarily been a widespread practice in the community:onesurveyofbiomedicaltext-miningtoolsfoundthat7/20WebsitesdisseminatingBioNLPfunctionalitycould not pass a simple software test commonly executed by professional software testers (Cohen andHunter, unpublisheddata). TherehavebeenvariousattemptstopromulgatesoftwaretestingwithintheBioNLP community. Cohen et al. (2004) presented a test suite generator for GM systems, and Johnsonet al. (2007b) presented a fault model for testing ontology mapping, alignment, and linking systems.However, the impact of this work has been low so far. Cohen et al. (2008a) compared the eﬃcacy ofstandard software testing approaches against running a huge corpus through a system, and found thathigher code coverage was achievable in very short times by using manually constructed test suites thanby using even very large corpora. They also noted that monitoring coverage was an eﬀective methodfor steering a testing project, and that attempts to increase it quickly led to the discovery of previouslyunknownshowstopperbugs.Cookbook-styleintroductionstosoftwaretestingarewidelyavailabletoday,includingagrowingliteratureonusingJUnittodowhiteboxtestingofJavacodeandanumberofgoodbooksonblack-boxfunctionaltesting,suchasKaneretal.(1999).
25.7.2 User Interface Design
User interface design has received little attention in the BioNLP ﬁeld. In fact, one study comparingacademic and commercial BioNLP tools found that although the commercial tools demonstrated noadvances in language processing abilities over academic systems, and in fact often lagged behind theacademicsystemsintheareaofnamedentityrecognition,thecommercialsystemsprovideduserinterfacesthatwerefarsuperiortoanythingavailablethroughtheacademiccommunity.
Thebest-executedworkonuserinterfaceevaluationtodatewascarriedoutinthecontextofBerkeley’s
BioText project, and the best of it can function as a tutorial on user interface evaluation. The projectfocussed on information retrieval. One such study evaluated the eﬃcacy of searching ﬁgure captions infull-text journal articles (Hearst et al. 2007). The group implemented a search tool for ﬁgure captions,motivatedbytheobservationthatbiomedicalresearcherstendtoapproachanarticlebyﬁrstscanningitstitle,abstract,ﬁgures,andﬁgurecaptions.Othertools,mostnotablyPubMed/MEDLINE,alreadyenablesearchingviawordsinthetitleandabstract,andGoogleScholarenablessearchingwordsinthefulltextbody;thiswastheﬁrsttooltospeciﬁcallyallowsearchingﬁgurecaptions.Theythenperformedausabilitystudy, evaluating whether or not users found the caption search and the display of associated ﬁgures to

The format of the study was thatusersweretoldthattheywereparticipatinginanevaluationofasearchinterface,althoughtheywerenottoldthattheresearchershadinfactbuiltthatinterface.Theywereshowntwoformatsforresultdisplay,in varying orders of presentation. Users then executed queries of their own design for 10minutes, andthen completed a survey answering several questions about their reaction to the system. Seven out ofeight users returned scores indicating that they liked the system and would be likely to use it, and usersshowedapreferenceforonedisplaystrategyovertheother.Crucially,thestudyresultedinanumberofdesign improvements, including additions to the types of links in the display, changes in the workﬂow,anddiﬀerentsortingstrategies.

25.7.3 Portability
Oneofthepersistent(andmostlyunaddressedbytheacademiccommunity)problemsinBioNLPhasbeenthecreationofsystemsthatcanbeportedtonewdomainsbythesystemusers.Manymachine-learning-based systems can be retrained on new data, but this requires the possession of sometimes signiﬁcantcomputationalskills.Systemsthatcanbeadaptedbyaresearcheroracliniciantotheirproblemhavenotbeen seen outside of the industrial community. The user portability problem is a fruitful area for futureresearch.
25.7.4 Proposition Banks and Semantic Role Labeling in BioNLP
As yet, there has not been a large proposition bank created in the BioNLP domain. However, there hasbeen a small pilot project (Wattarujeekrit et al. 2004) that has stimulated fruitful research in the areaof argument structure in the biomedical domain. It seems to be the case that semantic representationsin this domain have fewer adjunctive arguments and make greater use of core arguments than is thecase in General English (Cohen and Hunter 2006). This has repercussions for corpus construction, forsemanticrolelabeling,andfortheacceptancebybiologistsofclaimsaboutbiomedicalpredicatesemantics:biologistsarelikelytoinsistthatinformationthatwouldbeinadjunctsinaPropBank-likerepresentationareessentialtointerpretingthepredicateandmustbeconsideredcorearguments.
