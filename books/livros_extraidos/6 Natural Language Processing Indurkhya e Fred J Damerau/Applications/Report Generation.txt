22.1 Introduction
The ﬁrst sense of the term reportin theLongman Dictionary of Contemporary English is “a written or
spoken description of a situation or event, giving people the information they need.” This is preciselywhatreporthas come to mean in NLP—with the restriction that it is, as a rule, written information.
∗
Report generation (RG) thus stands for the automatic production of written material required by the
users.Usually,thismaterialisproducedfromstructureddata—numericaltimeseriesoraformalcontentrepresentation;itslengthmayrangefromoneparagraphtoseveralpages.
RG is a domain-speciﬁc application of Natural Language Generation (NLG). Since the early days of
NLG, report generators have been developed for a number of diﬀerent domains—among them labormarket (Rösner, 1986; Iordanskaja et al., 1992), stock market (Kukich, 1983; Reiter and Dale, 2000),weather (Elhadad and Robin, 1996; Coch, 1998; Yao et al., 1998; Sripada et al., 2003), air quality(BusemannandHoracek,1997;Wanneretal.,2007),patienthistories(BontchevaandWilks,2004),andteamgamecommentaries(Robin,1994).Anumberofreportgeneratorspassedbeyondtheprototypicalimplementation; some of them reached an operational state; see, e.g., FoG (Goldberg et al., 1994),

However, given that since then the state of the art in RGadvancedandnewthemeshavecometothefore, itwasnecessarytorestructurethischapterinordertoreﬂecttheseadvances.Inparticular,wefeltthatitisnecessarytogivemoreprominencetotheindividualtasks in RG—input and background data assessment and interpretation, user modeling, text planning,linguisticrealization—andtheevaluationofreportgenerators.InSection22.2,wediscussthefeaturesthatmake RG distinct from other NLG applications.

22.2 What Makes Report Generation a Distinct Task?
With the advance of the state of the art in NLG, the horizon of RG widened as well. Thus, while someyearsago,theobjectivesingle-viewstatementoffactwasstillanessentialcharacteristicofRG(KittredgeandPolguère,2000),inmorerecentapplications,addressee-tailoredreporting,whichearlierusedtobeafeatureofgeneraldiscourseNLG,andevensubjectivereporting,isincreasinglyondemand.LetusdiscusswhyitremainsmeaningfultomakeacleardistinctionbetweenRGandotherapplicationsofNLG.
22.2.1 What Makes a Text a Report?
If we cast the deﬁnition of reportin the Longman dictionary into more formal and more precise terms
(and restrict it to written material), we obtain the following three properties that can be assumed tounderly any report generated by automatic means: (1) be informative, (2) imply the notion of relevancetotheaddresseeinquestion,(3)targetanevent,asituationor,ingeneral,astateofaﬀairsthattakesplaceintime.
A whole range of automatically generated material does not necessarily show some or all of these
properties. Thus, automaticallygeneratednarrations(Kimetal., 2002; CheongandYoung, 2006; Szilas,2007), poetry (Gervás, 2001), or humoristic stories (Binsted and Ritchie, 1996) are not meant to informtheaddressees,butrathertoentertainthem.
The notion of relevance implies a prior assessment of the input data with respect to the information
needs of the addressee and, thus, indirectly, user-oriented content selection and, in some cases, alsocontentsummarization.Applicationswhosesolepurposeistorenderagivenabstractrepresentationintowordingdonothavethisproperty,eveniftheproducedinformationisjudgedusefultotheaddresseeandis informative. Exclass (Caldwell and Korelsky, 1994), which generates job descriptions, and AlethGen(Coch,1996),whichgeneratesrepliestocomplaintsofclientsofacataloguesellingservice,areexamplesofsuchapplications.
Technical instructions (Rösner, 1994; Paris et al., 1995) and travel guides (Lu et al., 2000) are also
informative.Theymayalsoinvolveuser-tailoredcontentselectionandsummarization:imaginethecasewhereatouristleaﬂetistailoredtoanindividualinhis50sinterestedinopera;obviously,thisleaﬂetwill

To these three properties, we may add a fourth property that is not deﬁnitorial, but nonetheless
characteristicofthemajorityofthereports,namely(4)describearecurrentstateofaﬀairs.Therecurrencycriterion is of practical (rather than theoretical) nature: automatic RG becomes justiﬁed if the state ofaﬀairsinquestionoccurswithacertainfrequency.
As mentioned above, in the past, automatically generated reports were assigned a further property:
reﬂectionofanobjectivesingle-viewstatement.However,thispropertydoesnotalwaysapply.Inthecaseofagasturbinemonitoringbulletinasproduced,e.g.,bySumTime-Turbine(Yuetal.,2007),indeedonlyoneviewisrequired: theviewoftheexpertwhohastojudgewhetherthereisaneedforinterventionornot.Similarly,inthecaseofthegenerationofweatherforecastsforoﬀshoreoilrigsasdonebySumTime-Mousam(Sripadaetal.,2003),onlytheperspectiveoftheworkersstationedontheoilrigsisrequired.Butin the case of air quality bulletins as produced by MARQUIS (Wanner et al., 2007), diﬀerent views areclearly disirable: air quality information is relevant to joggers, individuals with weak health conditions,air quality experts, public administrations, etc.; each of them is interested in speciﬁc details that do notneed to coincide with the details the others are interested in; nor is the presentation of the details in thebulletinthesameforallofthem.

iscommonlyreferredtoas sublanguage (KittredgeandLehrberger,1982).

Textstructureconventions predeterminewhetherthetextbodyistobedividedintoseveralparagraphs

Discourse structure conventions predetermine the order of the messages within a paragraph and
the discourse relations between the messages. For example, a soccer game commentary begins with thementionoftheteamsandtheresultofthegame,ofwhichthenusuallyanelaborationisgiven.
Conventions on the syntactic patterns may require that several relative clauses and subordinate

While in general NLG, the use of collocations can still be limited in order to avoid the problem of theircodiﬁcation and their motivated selection, in RG, collocations express “how it is being talked” in thedomaininquestion.Theproblemofanadequatetreatmentofcollocationsisthusimminent.
ThefactthatRGdealswithspecializeddiscourseoftenhasdirectconsequencesforthearchitectureof
thereportgeneratorandtheapproachtotheindividualtasks—especiallyifthediscourseinquestionshowslimited variation at the diﬀerent stages of processing and thus does not require a strict modularizationof the tasks or the use of a formal theoretical framework. However, we should be aware that for manydomains the complexity of the linguistic style is higher than it appears at the ﬁrst glance such that athorough study of the requirements is advisable prior to making decisions concerning the architectureandprocessingstrategiesofthegenerator.
22.2.3 Characteristic Features of Report Generation
RG reveals the following characteristics, which are in accordance with the properties of a report andidiosyncrasiesofspecializeddiscoursediscussedabove:
(1) its input is composed of structured data: numerical data time series or an abstract content
representation;
(2) it implies assessment and interpretation of the input data, which can involve summarization in
accordancewithsome(possiblyimplicit)criteriaofrelevance;
(3) ittakestherestrictionsofthesublanguageoftheﬁeldinquestionintoaccount.
Report generators are typical “data-to-text” and “concept-to-text” applications. They take as input
structured data (e.g., one or several numerical time series measured by external devices or an abstractcontentrepresentation),whichrequire,atleasttoacertainextent,assessmentandinterpretation.Guidedby criteria of relevance to established norms or to the addressee, assessment and interpretation ofteninvolvesummarizationofthedata/content.
Strictlyspeaking,dataassessmentandinterpretationisnotnecessarilyanRGtask:itisneededforany
content presentation mode—be it a text, a table, a curve, or a diagram. In AI, this task has often beenattributedto expertsystems (GiarratanoandRiley,2005).Therefore,inmanyadvancedreportgenerators,
the data assessment and interpretation module is not considered part of the generator. However, someauthors also argue for the inclusion of assessment and interpretation into the RG system architecture(Reiter,2007).
While assessment converts data into content or makes inferences in a knowledge base, it does not
includetheselectionofthecontentthatistobecommunicatedinareportinordertosatisfytheneedsofthe user. Content selection constitutes a separate task, which can be omitted if the content of the entireinput structure is to be verbalized, as in the case of SEMTEX (Rösner, 1986), LFS (Iordanskaja et al.,1992), and FoG (Goldberg et al., 1994). In a few report generators, user proﬁle or context criteria aretaken into account to drive the selection; compare, for instance, MARQUIS and SumTime-Mousam. InTEMSIS(BusemannandHoracek,1997),theuserselectsthecontentdirectlyviaaninteractiveinterface.
From the discussion in Subsection 22.2.2 of the idiosyncrasies of sublanguages with which RG has
to deal at all levels of the linguistic description, it is obvious that report generators need to take theseidiosyncrasiesintoaccountinordertoproduceanaturallysoundingtext.
As far as the architecture of report generators is concerned, it is not diﬀerent from the architecture
common in general discourse NLG. Most often, this is a pipeline architecture (Reiter and Dale, 2000).The number of modules and the distribution of tasks among the modules varies (which is not diﬀerentfrom general discourse NLG generators). However, as already indicated above, the nature of the tasksaddressed by report generators is nearly always the same: (1) data assessment and interpretation, (2)content selection, (3) discourse planning, and (4) linguistic realization. In the following sections, wediscusswhatRGstartsfromandhowthetasks(1)through(4)tendtobeaddressedinRG.

The data format and the level of abstractionmay be rather diﬀerent. Thus, LFS (Iordanskaja et al., 1992), MARQUIS, TEMSIS, SumTime-Turbine(Yu et al., 2007), etc., take numerical time series; MIAKT (Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004) starts from astructure related to an ontology; PLANDOC (McKeown et al., 1995), BT-45 (Portet et al., 2009), etc.,draw upon both numerical time series and ontologies. In contrast to general discourse NLG, RG hardlyeverstartsfromlinguistic,semantic,orsyntacticstructures.
Numericaltimeseriesareverycommonasinputtoreportgenerators, whichclearlyliesinthenature
of the task: numerical series monitored over time call for an interpretation, an assessment of relevance,and a summarized verbal presentation. Consider, for illustration, a sample of the input received bySumTime-Turbine in Figure 22.1. Analogous, although smaller, time series are used by FoG (Goldbergetal.,1994),MARQUISandothertime-seriesbasedgenerators.

Thus, turbinemonitoringseriesaremuchlargerthan, e.g., airpollutantseries.However,thecomplexityoftheassessmentisnotnecessarilyproportionaltothesizeoftheseries.Thus, a major share of the assessment of any numerical series is a mathematicalcurve analysis in that itcontains, e.g., (1) determination of the start and end values within the considered interval of the series,(2)detectionofthesigniﬁcantrelativeandabsoluteminimaandmaxima;(3)identiﬁcationofsigniﬁcant

A typical example of static background information are legal notices in the air quality bulletins as

Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoidall outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged or heavy exertionoutdoors.The language conventions concern all levels of RG; they can be domain-oriented or cultural. Thus,
domain communication knowledge can be instrumental for the realization of the discourse structure
(Rambow,1990)andalsoinﬂuencethesyntacticstructuresofthesentencesinthereport.However,mostillustrativeisthedomainandculturedependencyofthevocabulary.Forinstance,intheweatherdomain,the notion of ‘hot’ depends on the cultural perception (coined by the geographical location); in the airqualitydomain,theperceptionofairqualityingeneralandofpollutantconcentrationsinparticularvariesfrom one region to another—which is even reﬂected in the environmental regulations of each countrythatassociateairqualityindexscaleswithlabelssuchas“good,”“bad,”“satisfactory,”etc.

The German Morgen‘morning’ can go until 12:00 p.m., and the Nachmittag ‘afternoon’ until 5:00 p.m.
at the latest. The diverging interpretation is occasionally reﬂected by the vocabulary; for instance, inGerman, a special term for ‘time before noon’— Vormittag—is available, while in English, French, etc.,
thisisstill morning.
22.3.1.3 User ModelsAdvanced RG is increasingly applied to domains that require a variation of the content and a languagestyleinwhichthiscontentispresenteddependingontheusermodel.
Ingeneral,ausermodelinNLGcanbeconsideredasbeingcomposedoftheproﬁleoftheuserandthe
historyofgeneration.Theproﬁlecapturestheuser’scharacteristicfeaturesthatarerelevanttogeneration;thehistorycontainstheinformationthathasalreadybeencommunicatedtotheuser(eitherinthecurrentorintheprevioussessions).Asarule,reportgeneratorsdonotprotocolthehistory.Therefore,wefocusontheproﬁle.
The proﬁle of a user may have the following dimensions: (1) expertise, (2) need for speciﬁc informa-
tion, (3) cultural background, and (4) interpersonal content bias, i.e., personal content interpretationpreferences.
TheexpertisedimensionisthemostobviousandtheoldestdimensioninNLG;see, e.g.,(Paris, 1993;
Zukerman and Litman, 2001). The standard range is ‘expert–intermediate–novice’ or a more detailedvariantthereof.InRG,insteadofaclearrange,other(domain-speciﬁc)typologiesthataretailoredtothe

Ontheotherhand, anexpertknowsthatbetween the concentration of ozone and the concentration of nitrogen dioxyde a reciproke correlationholds(andthusdoesnotneedanexplicitmentionofit),whileanaveragecitizendoesnot.Theexpertisedimension may also constrain lexicalization and inﬂuence the discourse structure. For instance, for anexpert,therelationbetweenthestatementontheconcentrationofapollutantandthestatementthattheairqualityreachedahealththreateninglevelisappropriatelyrealizedas

The dimension that speciﬁes the need for speciﬁc information is supposed to capture the distinct
content aspects that are of relevance to diﬀerent users. In MARQUIS, a jogger, an individual with weakheart conditions, and an individual with a respiratory disease will receive an air quality bulletin of thesamedegreeofdetail,butwithdeviatingcontent.Thisisbecauseozoneisespeciallycriticaltoindividualswith weak heart conditions (even if its concentration is only moderately elevated), ﬁne dust particles(PM

Thedimensionofculturalbackgroundmayberatherimportantinreportgeneratorsthataddressusers
from diﬀerent cultural regions. For instance, in Spain, users are less sensitive to the topic of air qualitythaninFinlandandusersinFinlandhaveadiﬀerentperceptionoflowtemperaturesthanusersinSpain.SuchculturalidiosyncrasiesmustbeconsideredinRGduringcontentselection,discourseplanning,andlexicalization.
Thedimensionoftheinterpersonalcontentbiasisadimensionthatcanbedispensedwithin“objective”
reporting on, for instance, gas turbine monitoring, weather, stock market exchange, etc. However, itturned out to be essential for RG in domains that are per sesubjective—as, e.g., game commentaries.
Thus,experimentsdemonstratedthatasoccergamecommentaryisjudgedbyanaddresseetobeofhigherquality if the content nuances and language are adapted to his personal preferences for a team—whichconﬁrmstheworkbyHovyinearlynon-reportNLG(Hovy,1988).
Traditionally, any user is assigned a predeﬁned proﬁle. However, when the diversity of information
that can be communicated is rather high and/or the user proﬁles cannot be unambiguously assignedinformation preferences, the possibility of a personiﬁcation of the proﬁle by the users is important. Forinstance, in MARQUIS, a new user is ﬁrst assigned a default proﬁle, which can be personalized duringtheregistrationprocedure.
22.3.2 Data Assessment and Interpretation
RG involves a data preprocessing stage that is ocassionally considered part of text planning (Kittredgeand Polguère, 2000). However, as pointed out in Section 22.2.3, it is very diﬀerent in nature from theothertasksrelatedtotextplanning,anditcouldbeevenconsideredasbeingoutsideRG.
The ﬁrst, basic, task in this stage that may be needed is the transformation of the input data format
intoamoreconvenientformatortherelationoftheinputdatatodataalreadyavailabletothegenerator.For instance, quantitative time series tables may be mapped onto equivalent XML-strucures (as, e.g., inAutoText(Bohnetetal.,2001)orMARQUIS).Strictlyspeaking,thistaskdoesnotinvolveanyassessmentorinterpretation.
The second task is the reinterpretation of the input data in terms of a diﬀerent scale or with respect
to a predeﬁned reference date. For instance, in the weather domain, the numerical value of the speed ofthe wind in km/h may be mapped onto a qualitative scale (‘light,’ ‘moderate,’ ‘strong,’ ...)orontothe
∗SumTime-Mousamgeneratedmarineweatherforecastsforoﬀshoreoilrigs,seealsoSection22.6.

540 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
Beaufortscale—dependingontheuser.Similarly,intheairqualitydomain,theactualconcentrationofapollutantsubstance(measuredin μg/m
3)mustbeprojectedontothecorrespondingindexscale(ranging,
for instance, from 1 to 6) and onto a qualitative scale (‘low,’ ‘moderate,’ ...). Furthermore, a givenconcentration, temperature, labor market ﬁgure, etc., is often compared to either a prominent ﬁguredetectedinthepast(as,e.g.,thenumberofunemployedinSEMTEX(Rösner,1986)andLFS(Iordanskajaetal.,1992))ortoapredeﬁnedreference(as,e.g.,alegallyﬁxedthresholdconcentrationinTEMSISandMARQUIS)andtheresultofthecomparisonisincorporatedintothecontent.
Thethirdtaskistheidentiﬁcationofpatternswithintheinputdataandtheassignmentofmeaningto
thesepatterns.Thus,ANA(Kukich,1983)derivesfromahalf-hourlypricetimeseriesofastock‘decrease’and ‘increase’ patterns. Similarly, in LFS the increase or decrease of the employment rate is determinedvia the evaluation of the numerical change between two consecutive months. MARQUIS’s assessmentmodule performs a mathematical curve analysis on the pollutant concentration time series in order toidentifythedecreases/increasesandthegradientsthereof,localmaximaandminima, etc.,andidentiﬁessemanticrelations(suchas‘cause,’‘part-of,’‘sequence,’etc.)betweenconceptualconﬁgurations—similarto BT-45, which also detects ‘cause,’ ‘includes,’ and ‘associates’ relations. In SumTime-Mousam, theinputdataaresegmentedinthatlinearintervalsinthedataareidentiﬁedbeforethesegmenteddataaremappedontoaconceptualrepresentation. IntheStreakgenerator(Robin, 1994; McKeownetal., 1995),no patterns are identiﬁed, but quantitative data are assigned conceptual fact structures that explicitly
representtheirmeaning(e.g.,thatagivennumericscoreisawinoraloss).
The fourth task is the abstraction of patterns—as, e.g., in ANA, where from the elementary ‘increase’

The ﬁfth task, which may be interrelated with the previous four, is the assessment of the relevance

22.4 Text Planning for Report Generation
TextplanninginNLGtraditionallyinvolvescontentselectionanddiscourseplanning.Thisisnotdiﬀerentin RG—although in the past, it has often been assumed that the report genre has a stereotype discoursestructure, which is best captured in terms of text schemas (McKeown, 1985) that are rigid to a majorextentandthatreducethetaskoftextplanningtotheminimum.Thisisabouttochange.
Depending on the concrete report generator, both tasks are dealt with in separate (sub)modules or
together in one single module; as a matter of fact, in most RG-systems, it is one module. The result oftextplanningisa textplan,whichisusuallyalreadypackagedsentence-wise,althoughitsdegreeofdetail
dependsonhowelaboratedthelinguisticrealizationmoduleis(seeSection22.5.1).
22.4.1 Content Selection
Thetaskofcontentselectioncanbeobsoleteiftheentirecontentstructureobtainedfromtheinputdatais communicated, as, e.g., in AutoText. However, in more advanced report generators, which deal withlargersetsofinputdataorwhichserveseveraltypesofusers,itassumesaprominentrole.
Contentselectionisguidedbycontentrelevancecriteria,whichmaybevalidingeneralorbespeciﬁcto
theuser, andbythepersonalpreferencesoftheuser. Thecontentselectionmechanismsusuallyoperateon the output of the data assessment and interpretation task. If no such task is foreseen, they navigatedirectlyonthecontentrepository(e.g.,ontologyorknowledgebase).

ReportGeneration 541
In BT-45 (Portet et al., 2009), the content selection algorithm selects from the content repository a
number of “key events” that have received a suﬃciently high relevance rating in the assessment stage.Along with a key event, events that are co-temporal with it or that are explicitly related to it by one ofthe predeﬁned relations are selected. The algorithm is controlled by a set of parameters and a numberof domain-speciﬁc rules that determine the relevance threshold for key events, the maximal number ofmessages that can be selected for communication, and so on. In MARQUIS, content selection is drivenby domain criteria (such as, e.g., the relation of the measured or forecasted pollutant concentrations tolegal or system-deﬁned threshold concentrations, the values of the concentration increase or decreasegradients, the primacy of the individual pollutants in the given region, etc.) and by user preferences.MIAKT (Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004) starts from the description of the case of the patient encoded bya medical expert in RDF. In principle, the entire case description (enriched by concepts from a medicaldomain ontology) is to be verbalized, such that no content selection is involved. However, the casedescription may contain duplicated RDF-triples and pairs of inverse triples. The content selection taskconsiststhusinremovingrepetitiveandinversetriples.
22.4.2 Discourse Planning
TheprimarytaskofdiscourseplanninginRGis discoursestructuring ,i.e.,thedeterminationoftheorder
between the paragraphs as well as between the messages within the individual paragraphs. FoG, ANA,AutoText, and anumber of othergenerators implementarigid schema-orientedplanning suchthattheorderoftheparagraphsinareporttheyproduceandtheorderofthestatementswithineachparagrapharepredetermined.However,inapplicationswherecontentselectionisdynamictoalargeextent,thisstrategycanbeproblematic. Therefore, inmorerecentreportgenerators, moreﬂexiblestructuringstrategiesareused. For instance, in BT-45, key events (see above) are always mentioned ﬁrst. They are followed byevents that are explicitly linked to the key event, which are in their turn followed by other co-temporalevents.Themessagesonakeyeventwiththemessagesontheeventsthatarerelatedtoitformaparagraphin the report. The key event paragraphs are ordered by the start time of their respective key event. InLFS, statements are ordered according to their relative salience; a global salience assessment procedureensuresthatstatementsonthemostsigniﬁcanteconomicchangesaremovedtothebeginningofthetextplan.InMARQUIS,amixtureofschema-basedplanningattheparagraphlevelandtop-downdiscoursestructurebasedplanningwithintheindividualparagraphsisrealized(Wanneretal.,2007)—whichmakes,as in TechDoc (Rösner and Stede, 1992), a prior (context- and user-tailored) identiﬁcation of discourserelationsthatholdbetweenstatementsnecessary.
22.5 Linguistic Realization for Report Generation
The importance of the linguistic realization for RG is controversial. Thus, some report generators,such as TEMSIS, use templates, with gaps left open for words to be ﬁlled in. In SumTime-Mousam,SumTime-Turbine, and BT-45, linguistic realization plays a minor role; some attention is given only tolexicalizationandaggregation.Ontheotherside,weobserveratherelaboratelinguisticmodulesinGossip(Iordanskaja et al., 1991), FoG (Goldberg et al., 1994), LFS (Iordanskaja et al., 1992), Project Reporter(Korelskyetal.,1993),PLANDOC,andMARQUIS.McDonald(McDonald,1993)arguesthatrealizationis a relatively trivial task in generation. In reality, the importance and complexity of the linguisticrealization decisively depends on a variety of criteria into which we cannot delve here. It suﬃces to cite(Reiter,1995)thatathoroughcost-beneﬁtanalysisisneededtodecideuponthemostadequatelinguisticrealization.

542 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
22.5.1 Input and Levels of Linguistic Representation
The nature and degree of concretization of the text plan that serves as input to the linguistic realizationmodule depends on the linguistic framework that underlies a report generator. It can be more or lessabstract.ConsiderinFigure22.2theinputstructuretoStreak’s(Robin,1994;ElhadadandRobin,1996)linguisticmodulethatisbasedon SystemicFunctionalLinguistics (SFL)(HallidayandMatthiessen,1999;
Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004); PLANDOC, which is also based on SFL, deals with similar inputstructures.
Thelinguisticmodelsofreportgeneratorsthatarebasedonthe Meaning-TextTheory,MTT(Mel’čuk,
1988), among them Gossip, LFS, FoG, MultiMeteo, and MARQUIS, take as input either conceptualgraphsinthesenseofSowa(Sowa,2000)orsemanticpredicate-argumentstructuresofthekinddisplayedinFigure22.3.
Dependingonthelinguisticframeworkandthecomplexityofthelinguisticphenomenaofthedomain,
a message received as input to the linguistic realization module can undergo concretization in severalstages.Thenumberofstages(orlevelsoflinguisticrepresentation)varies.Thus,anumberofgenerators(amongthem,e.g.,TEMSISandtheSumTimegenerators)realizeadirectprojectionofcontentstructurestolexicalizedsyntacticstructures.Thisdoesnotexcludethatthelattercanbefurthermodiﬁed,aggregated,orparaphrased—butthelevelofabstractionremainsalwaysthesame.MTTdistinguishes,apartfromthesemanticstructure(SemS),adeep-syntactic(DSyntS),asurface-syntactic(SSyntS),adeep-morphological(DMorphS),andasurface-morphologicalstructure(SMorphS).Often,aconceptualstructureasaninter-face representation between content-oriented text plan codiﬁcation and semantic message codiﬁcationis added. Conceptual structures are language independent, while all the other structures are language-speciﬁc. But not all MTT-based generators use all of them. Thus, while MARQUIS uses indeed all, LFSuniﬁesDMorphSandSMorphS,andFoGalsoskipsSemS.
Inordertofacilitatethechoicebetweensemanticallyequivalentbutsyntacticallyandlexicallydeviating
variants (see, e.g., The high ozone concentration made the AQ index rise vs.T h eA Qi n d e xr o s ed u et o
the high ozone concentration in MARQUIS), some generators use the information (or, in the MTT
terminology, communicative )structure.Theinformationstructuredeﬁnesthedistributionofinformation

Current report generators that are not based on any formal linguistic framework tend to neglect the
information structure, but keep track of the anaphoric structure that contains the co-reference linksbetween units in order to be able to generate appropriate referring expressions by pronominalizing,choosingthedeﬁnitearticle,orahyperonym.
22.5.2 Tasks of Linguistic Realization
IngeneraldiscourseNLG,linguisticrealizationisoftendividedintothetasksofmicro-(sentence)planningand surface realization. Microplanning deals with such tasks as sentence packaging, syntactic structuredetermination,aggregation,lexicalization,andreferringexpressiongeneration.Surfacerealizationisthenaratherstraightforwardinstantiationoftheresultingstructureofmicroplanning.
In RG, usually only a subset of the microplanning tasks is addressed. Most of sentence packaging is,
as a rule, avoided in that each message is a priori considered a clause. Some generators use rule-basedalgorithms to merge either already available messages or clauses to obtain a more ﬂuid text (as, e.g.,BT-45).InStreakandPLANDOC,specialattentionisgiventolexicalization.22.5.2.1 Syntactic Structure DeterminationA number of generators use syntactic structure templates on which the content structures are mappeddirectly—as, e.g., SumTime-Turbine. These templates can be rather abstract and formal (in the case ofBT-45,inaHPSG-likeformat).
MostMTT-basedgenerators(e.g.,Gossip,LFS,MARQUIS)usetheTheme/Rhemedistributiondeﬁned
over the semantic (or conceptual) structures and the dominant orentrynode of the latter to determine
“deep-syntactic” structures. The dominant node, comparable to the key event in BT-45, becomes theroot of the syntactic tree; a Theme/Rheme partition embedded into another Theme or Rheme partitionbecomesasubordinateorrelativeclause.22.5.2.2 AggregationAggregation,i.e.,thefusionofpartlyoverlappingstructureswiththepurposetoavoidredundanciesandachieve a more ﬂuid text, can be carried out at diﬀerent levels of a linguistic representation (as, e.g.,in PLANDOC). Most often, however, it is done either prior to the linguistic realization proper at themessage (content) level (as in BT-45) or during the transition between the semantic and syntacticlevels(as in MARQUIS). However, it is important to be aware that aggregation can be semantic, syntactic, orlexical(Dalianis,1999),andthatformorecomplexRG,adiﬀerentiationmightbeneeded.22.5.2.3 LexicalizationLexicalization, i.e., the mapping of content or semantic units onto lexical units (LUs), is traditionallygivenamoreprominentroleinRG.Thisis,ontheonehand,duetotheprominentplaceoflexicalizationingeneraldiscourseNLG,and,ontheotherhand,duetotheidiosyncraticvocabularyofthesublanguagesinreportdomains.
Fourtypesoflexicalizationneedtobedealtwith:
(1) Full LUs, i.e., content words that correspond to one or several units in a message that is to be
lexicalized;
(2) Collocationalunitssuchas heavy storm ,dramatic loss, sharp rise , etc., wherethechoiceofoneof
theLUsiscontingentontheotherLU;

544 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
(3) Functional words whose introduction is controlled by either subcategorization or idiosyncratic
lexical restrictions of an LU, as, e.g., relevant to (and not *relevant for )a n dat[a]am e a s u r i n g
station(andnot*in [a]measuringstation);
(4) Discourse markers that connect messages and make explicit temporal, causal, and other types of
relationsthatholdbetweenthesemessages.
The majority of the report generators focuses on the choice of full LUs. For instance, BT-45 maps
messages onto case frame like representations with a verbal predication as the head and thematic rolesasarguments.Thelexicalizationisstraight-forwardlylinkedtotheontology.InSumTime-Mousam, theinput to microplanning are tuples of the kind (0600, 8, 13, W, nil): time, wind speed lower range, windspeed higher range, wind direction, “modiﬁer” (such as ‘gust,’ ‘shower’); each element in the tuple hasanumberoflexicalizedphrasetemplatesassociatedwithit. InMARQUIS,the semanticdictionary gives
foreachsemantemeallitspossiblelexicalizations.Forinstance,themeaning‘cause’ismappedtotheLUs
CAUSE[V],CAUSE[N],RESULT [V],RESULT [N],DUE,BECAUSE,CONSEQUENCE ,etc.
Most of the MTT generators use the advanced lexicalization instrument oﬀered by the theory—the
lexical functions , LFs (Mel’čuk, 1996). LFs are a formal means to encode idiosyncratic names and
collocationsinagenericway.Inafunctionalnotation,theyarewrittenasfollows:Magn(storm)= heavy,
Magn(loss)=dramatic ,Oper1(concentration)=have,IncepFunc 2(concentration)=reach ,etc.TheLFsof
anLUmaybereferencedinthesemanticdictionaryforlexicalization(asinMARQUIS)orbechoseninaparaphrasingstagethatfollowsthedefaultlexicalization(asinLFS).
With a few exceptions, as, e.g., ANA (Kukich, 1983), other report generators that are not based on
MTTdonotdealwithcollocations.ANAencodesthemina phrasallexicon (Becker,1975).Theproblem
ofencodingphraseologicalinformationinalexiconofthistypeisthatitishardtoextendandmaintain.Thatis,itmightmeanarichvarietyoflexicalizationinsmalldomains(suchasinstockmarketreportsinthecaseofANA),butcanhardlysustainalargescalegeneratorinanoperationalmode.

Compilers were run six times (the cpu-time equal to 46%of the total cpu-time). Editors were run twelve times (the cpu-time equal to 53%of the total cpu-time). Two users, Martin and Jessie, logged on to the system.Martin used the system for 63% of the time in use. Jessie used the system for 40%of the time in use.

Theinputdatarecordtrailsareprocessedbythe TextStructuringandContentDeterminationModule
(TSCDM) (Carcagno and Iordanskaja, 1992). The backbone of the TSCDM is the Topic Tree (TT)—a
predeﬁnedhierarchicalorderingofthepotentialtopicsinthedomainofOSreports.Forcontentselection,the TT is traversed and the individual topics are instantiated accessing the data trails (in the DB) andmakinginferences; ifnoinformationisavailableonthetopic, thetopicisdropped. TheinstantiatedTTundergoes some further transformations before it is mapped onto conceptual-communicative represen-
tations(conceptual graphs a la Sowa (Sowa, 2000), enriched by the Theme/Rheme structure), which in
their turn are mapped onto semantic representations (semantic structures enriched by Theme/Rhemestructures) in the sense of the MTT. Semantic representations are then used as input to the linguisticrealizationmoduletogeneratereportsofthetypeshowninFigure22.4.
Gossip was one of the ﬁrst report generators to use fully spelled out text planning and linguistic
realizationmodules.Inparticular,italreadyusestheTheme/Rhemestructureasaguidancecriterionforchoice at all levels of generation. It did not become operational—as its developers point out, due to thelackofalargeenoughusercommunity.FoGFoG (ForecastGenerator) is one of the few operational report generators (Goldberg et al., 1994;
Kittredge et al., 1986). It produces two types of bilingual (English and French) weather bulletins: public
andmarineforecasts. The input to FoG are meteorological data time series (such as wind direction and
speed, precipitation (type) and temperature). The ﬁrst processing stage of the input data is “space andtime merging”—the segmentation of the individual data along the temporal and geographical axes (seealso SumTime-Mousam below). For instance,
∗in the case of a continuous range of wind direction and
wind speed in a speciﬁc time interval as in the case of (1100Z, 170, 4, 0, -22) ,(1200Z, 180, 5,
0, -21),(1300Z, 180, 4, 0, -21) , where from 11:00 to 13:00 the wind direction is predicted to be
between 170 and 180 (compass) degrees, with a wind speed between 4 and 5, the time merger wouldproduce a tuple of the type:
winds, (1 3 di s sp 4 5) , where the ﬁrst two elements of the tuple (‘1’
and‘3’)specifythetimeinterval(inhoursaftertheissueoftheforecast),‘di’standsfor“direction,”‘s’for“sourth,”‘sp’for“speed,”andthelasttwoelements(‘4’and‘5’)specifythewindspeed.Themergeofdatafor geographically continuous areas (space merging) is done in a similar way. The obtained tuples arepassed to the text planner, which outputs a conceptual (language-independent) structure similar to theoneproducedinGossip.Theconceptualstructureisthenprocessedbythelinguisticrealizationmodule,which is based on a simpliﬁed MTT-model. Refer to Figure 22.5 for a report produced by FoG for twomergedareas, BELLE ISLE andNORTHEAST COAST.

The unemployment rate increased by 0.2 to 7.6.EmploymentFor the week ended November 3, 1989, the seasonally adjusted level of employmentwas estimated at 12568000, up 32000 from October. The increase was concentratedamong women aged 25 and over. The employment/population ratio remained virtuallyunchanged (62.1).Employment among women aged 25 and over rose by 44000 and theiremployment/population ratio increased by 0.5 to 52.3.Employment among men aged 25 and over fell by 12000 and theiremployment/population ratio decreased by 0.3 to 72.5....Employment fell by 10000 in agriculture, by 12000 in transportation, communicationand other utilities and by 12000 in primary industries other than agriculture.Employment rose by 68000 in servises and by 20000 in trade. It remained virtuallyunchanged in the other sectors....

SumTime-Mousam tailors the forecasts to the preferences of the end users, or more precisely, to

From the input data, SumTime-Mousam derives representations of the kind (0600, 8, 13, W, nil),
(1500, 8, 13, SW, nil), (2400, 10, 15, S, nil)—with the ﬁrst element of each tuple as time, the second andthird as the forcasted wind range, the fourth as wind direction, and ﬁfth as additional information ofthe type ‘gust,’ ‘shower,’ etc. Each tuple element is associated with a predeﬁned phrase template that isinstantiatedwithit.Figure22.9showsasamplereportgeneratedbySumTime-Mousam.MIAKT MIAKT (Medical Imaging and Advanced Knowledge Technologies) is one of the few report

The 68 years old patient is involved in a triple assessment procedure. The tripleassessment procedure contains a mammography exam. The mammography exam is carriedout on the patient on 2 9 1995. The mammography exam produced a right CC image.The right CC image contains an abnormality and the right CC image has a rightlateral side and a craniocaudal view. The abnormality has a mass, a probablymalignant assessment, a microlobulated margin, and a round shape.

based on MTT (Wanner et al., 2007). MARQUIS produces user-tailored air quality information for ﬁveEuropeanregionsinCatalan,English,Finnish,French,German,Polish,Portuguese,andSpanish.Whenappropriate,thereportscontaintablesandgraphicstocomplementthetext.
MARQUIS takes as input times series of the major air pollution substances delivered by regional
air quality measurement networks. The size of the networks (and thus also the size of the time series)varies between 7 and 65 monitoring stations. The time series are interpreted by the Assessment andInterpretation Module (AIM), which identiﬁes the global and local minima and maxima, the gradientsof the changes of pollutant concentrations, the relation of the measured concentrations to predeﬁnedthreshold concentrations, etc., and assesses the results of the analysis with respect to their relevance toanyoftheuserscapturedinMARQUIS’susertypology.TheusertypologyinMARQUISisratherdetailedandcanbefurtherpersonalizedbyregisteredusers(seeSection22.3.1.3).

The air quality index is 3, which means that the air quality is satisfactory.This is due to the ozone concentration. The NO
2concentration and the PM10
concentration do not contribute to the index.The current air quality index is the highest of the whole day. The lowest indexwas 2 (at midnight). Between midnight and 9am, the air quality index remainedstable at 2, and between 10am and 3pm it remained stable at 3.The ozone concentration (70μgr/m3) is relatively low. As a result, noharmful effects to human health are expected. Between 4am and 10am, the ozoneconcentration increased considerably from 22 to 76 μgr/m3. The current ozone
concentration is close to the highest of 76μgr/m3.

monitoring data time series (Yu et al., 2007). One of the distinctive features of SumTime-Turbine iscertainly the size of the time series it has to handle: several hundreds of MB daily of data of the kinddisplayed in Figure 22.1. From such time series, SumTime-Turbine generates summaries illustrated inFigure22.12.
Given the size of the time series, it is not surprising that the focus of the work in SumTime-Turbine
has been on the assessment and interpretation of the data, which consists of three stages: (1) patternrecognition, (2) pattern abstraction, and (3) relevant pattern selection. Typical patterns (captured in anontology)arespikesandoscillations.Aggregationisdoneatthelevelofpatterns(ratherthanattheleveloflinguisticstructures).ThelinguisticrealizationinSumTime-Turbineistemplate-based.BT-45BT-45 is the ﬁrst prototype of the BabyTalk project, which targets the generation of textual
summaries of neonatal clinical data time series for diﬀerent purposes and diﬀerent target users (Portetetal.,2009).Figure22.13showsareportgeneratedbyBT-45.
The purpose of BT-45 is to present information in a narrative form, highlighting aspects assessed to
besalient.ComparedtothetwoSumTimegenerators,BT-45isconsiderablymoreadvancedwithrespectto the assessment of data, document planning and linguistic realization. The assessment is divided into

In moredetail, there were dips with oscillatory recoveries in TTXD-3 and TTXD-4, followed1s later by dips with oscillatory recoveries in TTXD-1, TTXD-2, TTXD-5, andTTXD-6. This occurred between 12:59:17 and 12:59:54.

22.7 Evaluation in Report Generation
Due to the ultimate purpose of any report generator—the operational use—the issue of evaluationbecomesincreasinglyimportantinRG.Tobeevaluatedis,ontheonehand,thecoverageoftherelevantinformation communicated in reports produced by a generator, i.e., whether the information oﬀered isrelevant and whether relevant information has been ommitted, and, on the other hand, the (linguistic)qualityofthepresentationoftheinformation.Themoststandardevaluationpracticeistheassessmentoftheproducedsummariesbydomainandlanguageexpertswithrespecttocriteriaconcerningusefulnessand linguistic quality outlined in a questionnaire. Such a technique has been applied, e.g., in AutoTextand MARQUIS. However, other, more purpose-oriented, evaluation techniques can also be applied.For instance, in SumTime-Mousam, the evaluation metrics has been the number of amendment editsof a professional weather forecaster (recall that SumTime-Mousam generates weather forecasts) in aSumTime-Mousam generated report. In the case of BT-45, the utility of the automatically generatedreports for decision support making by medical personnel has been evaluated: the participants of theevaluationexperimentwereconfrontedwithanumberofdiﬀerentscenarios, writteneitherbyahumanorgeneratedbyBT-45, andaskedtochoosetheappropriateactionfromanumberofoﬀeredoptionstorespondtothesituationdescribedinthescenario.ThechoicesmadeinconnectionwithBT-45summarieswere compared with the reference choices and the choices made in connection with human writtensummaries.
A further evaluation technique is the use of metrics (such as BLEU) to compare the proximity of
the automatically generated reports with human written reports from the same input data. However,in contrast to, e.g., Machine Translation, automatic metrics are not yet widely used in RG. This islikely to change. Recently, research of adequate evaluation methods in NLG became a prominent issueaddressedinshared-taskchallengesandotherevents. AdvancesinthisdirectionwillwithoutanydoubtbeneﬁtRG.
22.8 Conclusions: The Present and the Future of RG
We discussed the tasks related to RG and presented a number of representative report generators. Alook into Kittredge and Polguère’s chapter in the ﬁrst edition of the Handbook shows that within thelast 8 years, the ﬁeld of RG experienced some signiﬁcant changes. First, the context of the work on RGshiftedfromthesisprojectstomultiplepartnerorcommercialinitiatives,withtheparticipationofdomainexperts.ThisisaclearsignthatthepotentialofRGhasbeenrecognizedbytheusers.Itistoexpectedthatthis trend will be further strengthened. Second, some tasks are about to receive a higher weight than itusedtobeinthepast.Thisisespeciallythecasefordataassessmentandinterpretationandevaluation.Inasense,thisisconsistentwiththeﬁrstchangesincebothtasksimplytheparticipationofdomainexperts.

552 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
In a series of recent report generators, linguistic realization is given rather little attention, which
automatically leads to limited ﬂuency and variation of the generated summaries. However, disturbingrepetition of both word choices and syntactic structures can be also observed in applications with moredeveloped linguistic realization modules. We believe that this is a sign that RG needs more powerfulsentenceplanningmechanismsthanthosethatareusedsofar.
On the negative side of RG, it can be furthermore observed that currently RG is still dominated
by English—although, for instance, AutoText generates German air quality summaries, the CoGenTexgenerators traditionally work with English and French, and some generators are multilingual (as, e.g.,MultiMeteo,TEMSIS,andMARQUIS).InparticularAsianreportgeneratorssuchas,forinstance,(Yaoetal.,1998)forweatherreportgenerationinChinese,arestillveryrare.Thesituationwillcertainlychangein the near future. Especially in Europe multilinguality is about to become a prominent issue, and withthesocietygoingmultilingual,RGwillneedtoreactaccordingly.
