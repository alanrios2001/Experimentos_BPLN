24.1 Introduction
As humans, we base our decisions on our knowledge about the world, which we have acquired througheducation, reading, reﬂection, conversation, etc. We all have substantial commonsense knowledge aswellasknowledgeabouthowourworldisstructured,whichguidesusinourdailylives,helpsustotakedecisions,etc.

•Content and functionality description at a “semantic level:” By describing content (e.g., of Web
sites) as well as functionality (e.g., of services or programs) at a semantic level, the matching ofcontenttoinformationneedsordiscoveringappropriateserviceswillbemoreeﬀectivecomparedto pure matching at a syntactic level (e.g., as done in current search engines to match contentto information needs or relying mainly on method signatures for services). Describing resources(services, multimedia content, etc.) semantically is in fact the crucial aim of the Semantic Web(Berners-Lee et al., 2001). A semantic description of service functionality will also enable morecomplex tasks such as Web service composition into a workﬂow (McIlraith et al., 2001; Paoluccietal.,2001;Sirinetal.,2003).
•Providing relevant background knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks : e.g., in expert systems
(Russel and Norvig, 2003) that help users to take better decisions in speciﬁc domains speciﬁcdomains as in the well-known MYCIN expert system (see Shortliﬀe, 2001). Natural languageprocessing is another good example for this, where relevant background knowledge can help indisambiguation (lexical, syntactic, semantic, quantiﬁer scope, etc.), discourse analysis (anaphoraresolution,bridgingreferenceresolution,inferringdiscourserelations),etc.

24.2 Ontology and Ontologies
While ontologies currently have the status of designed artifacts in computer science, ontologyoriginally
was a (philosophical) discipline concerned with the study of existence and the formal description of thestructure of reality. According to Barry Smith, “Ontology as a branch of philosophy is the science of whatis,ofthekindsandstructuresofobjects,properties,events,processesandrelationsineveryareaofreality. ”
(Smith, 2003, corresponding to Deﬁnition 1 in Guarino and Giaretta, 1995). According to this view,ontology is a universal discipline and deals with existence independent of any speciﬁc domains and ofanybeliefsystems.
∗
Aristotle(384–322BC)cancertainlybecalledtheﬁrstontologistashefundamentallyshapedthenature
of ontologies as we understand them today (compare Sowa, 2000). Aristotle however never mentionedthe word ontologyin his works, which was introduced in the seventeenth century independently by two
philosophers:RudolfGöckelinhis LexiconPhilosophicum (Göckel,1613)andJacobLorhardinhis Ogdaes
Scholasticas Lorhard(1606)(compareSmith,2003;Ohrstrometal.,2005).Aristotlehimselfreferredtothe
studyofexistenceas“ﬁrstphilosophy.”Inhisworkson Categories

classiﬁcation,developingasystemforclassiﬁcationconsistingof10basiccategories: substance,quantity,
quality,relation,place,time,situation (orposition), state(orcondition), action,andaﬀection (orpassion)
(compare Studtmann, 2007). In the fundamental work described in the Categories , Aristotle introduced
thebasicontologicalnotionsweusetoday: universals (alsoknownasclassesorconcepts)and particulars
(also known as instances, individuals, or objects). Aristotle further established the basis for taxonomiesas used in ontologies and knowledge representation nowadays. In order to come up with a taxonomicalorganizationofthings,Aristotleproposeda“methodofdivision”accordingtowhichageneralcategory(agenus)isspecializedintoseveral(subgenera orspecies)bymeansofdiﬀerentiae ,i.e.,propertiesonwhich
theydiﬀerfromeachother.
From the computer science point of view, ontologies
‡can be deﬁned as logical theories describing
some aspect of reality. Typically, such logical theories describe a speciﬁc domain, i.e., some part ofreality that is of relevance to a set of applications (compare the use of domain of discourse in database
andinformationsystemdesign). Forexample, wecoulddeﬁneanontologyforthedomainofacademia,such as the SWRC ontology (Sure et al., 2005), for medicine (Grenon et al., 2004), biochemistry (TheGeneOntologyConsortium,2000)etc.Suchontologieswillbetypicallyusedforapplicationsinwhichadeclarativedescriptionofthedomainisuseful,forexample,inordertoinferimplicitdomainknowledge,forintegratingdiﬀerentdatasources,etc.

paper, stored in an electronic ﬁle, etc. Further, some of the deﬁnitions require an ontology to be formal
(Deﬁnition 3 through 5, but also 1 according to the further descriptions in Gruber (1993)), i.e., in thesense that it should have a formal semantics and be machine readable as well as interpretable. Finally,someresearchers(seeDeﬁnition5)requireanontologytobe sharedamongdiﬀerentpeople.

24.2.1 Anatomy of an Ontology
In this section we give a brief overview of the prototypical axiomatic constructs found in ontologies. Ifwedissectaprototypicalontology(e.g.,modelinginformationaboutmedievalEuropeancities)wemightﬁndthefollowing:
•Subclass axioms: For example, Church is subclass of Building in the sense that all members
of the class of churches are contained in the class of buildings. This is referred to as “extensionalsubsumption.”Normally,wealsosaythat“theclassofbuildingssubsumestheclassofchurches.”
•Non-taxonomic relations: For example, the relation between a church and its style, which can bemodeledthroughthe hasStyle relationforexample.
•Domainandrangerestrictions (onrelations):Foracertainrelation,i.e., hasStyle,theontology
might restrict which kind of entities can stand at the domain and range positions, respectively.At the range position we would expect, say, Architectonic_artefact, while at the range
positionwewouldexpectsome Architectonic_style.
•Cardinality constraints : We would for example like to say that each Basilica has at least one
Apse. This can be done by attachinga cardinality constraint of “at least 1” to the correspondingrelationintheontology.
•Part-of relations: Have a special ontological status and have received special attention in theknowledgerepresentationliterature(Artaleetal.,1996).Whilethereareclearlydiﬀerenttypesof“part-of”relations,wewillglossoverthisaspecthere(butseeArtaleetal.,1996onthisissue).Wecouldforexamplespecifythattherecanbeapart-ofrelationbetweena TowerandtheChurch

•Disjointness: To further constrain the models of our logical theory, we might want to add alsoso-called disjointness axioms between classes which essentially state that the classes cannot havecommon elements. For instance, we would specify that the classes StyleandChurch are
disjoint, i.e., there is no thing which is a style and a church at the same time. While such thingslooktrivialforusashumans,foramachineprocessingourontologythereisinprinciplenoreasonwhythesetwoclassescannotshareelements.

24.2.2 Types of Ontologies
Many researchers have attempted to provide a classiﬁcation of ontologies according to type. Guarino
(1998a), for example, distinguishes between the following types of ontologies (graphically depicted in
termsofaspecializationrelationinFigure24.1):
•Top-levelontologies :describingverygeneralconceptsrelatedtotime,space,matter,etc.
•Domainontologies :describingthevocabularyinaspeciﬁcdomain.
•Task ontologies : describing the vocabulary of a generic task or activity, such as the task of selling
something.
•Application ontologies : describing concepts that are often specializations of domain and task
ontologies.Consideradomainontologyaboutbooksandataskontologyaboutselling,anonline
bookretailerwouldspecializebothontologiestodescribeabooksellingserviceforexample.
Thesetypesappear in similar waysalso in otherclassiﬁcations(compare Studer et al., 1998; Uschold,
1996, but also the orthogonal classiﬁcation in Hovy, 2005). Further, Uschold (1996) has suggested a
classiﬁcationofontologiesaccordingtothefollowingdimensions:
•Degree of formality : ranging from highly informal (e.g., glossaries), structured informal over
semiformal torigorouslyformal .
•Purpose:mentioningdiﬀerentpurposessuchas(1) communicationbetweenpeople ,(2)interoper-
ability(betweensystems),wheretheontologyisusedasaninterchangeformatand(3) knowledge
reuseacrosssystems,aswellas(insoftwareengineering)(4)veriﬁcationby automatedconsistency
checksandassistanceintheprocessofrequirementsspeciﬁcation.
•Subject matter : distinguishing (similarly to Guarino) between domain ontologies ,task, method
or problem-solving ontologies ,a n dmeta-ontologies , i.e., ontologies describing the vocabulary and
semanticsofaknowledgerepresentationlanguage.
Besides the diﬀerent categories introduced by diﬀerent researchers, the important message to bear in
mindisthatontologiescanbeengineeredforverydiﬀerent(butalllegitimate)purposes.
24.2.3 Ontology Languages
As ontologies are in essence logical theories, we need logical formalisms to write such logical theories
down(i.e.,somesyntax)aswellassomespeciﬁcationoftheirformalsemantics(i.e.,adeﬁnitionoflogical
consequence) in order to reason over the theory. For the purpose of formalizing ontologies, typically

European and U.S. groups. DAML+OIL can be regarded as providing the foundations for OWL, which

•RDF: The Resource Description Framework essentially provides the vocabulary to express
triples—i.e., constructs of the shape (subject,predicate,object) —which allow to
provide elementary statements like the fact that Berlin is the capital of Germany, i.e.,
(Berlin,capitalOf,Germany) . One of the important characteristics of RDF and which
makesitespeciallysuitablefortheWebisthatitreliesonthecrucialnotionofaURIinthesense
of a unique identiﬁer allowing us to point to “things” (or “resources” as they are called in RDF).
ThisisessentialforaWebinwhichsitespointtocontent(orthings)onothersites,thusreﬂecting
the true distributional architecture of the Web as we know it today. URIs thus provide the basis
for talking about identity. However, it is not the case that RDF adopts the UNA (Unique Name
Assumption), thus allowing diﬀerent URIs to refer to the same thing (after all we cannot force
peopletousethesameURIs,butonlyencourageit!).
•RDF Schema , abbreviated as RDFS, extends RDF in the sense of providing additional machinery
for describing the vocabulary used in the triples in terms of their relation to other vocabulary

24.2.4 Ontologies and Natural Language
There has been substantial debate over the relation between ontologies and lexica as well as betweenontologies and natural language in general. We intend to shed light on this relation along the followinglines: (1) the relation between ontologies and lexica, (2) the role of ambiguity in ontologies, and (3) adiscussionoftheissuewhetherthedesignofontologiesshouldbeguidedbylinguisticdistinctions.24.2.4.1 Ontologies and LexicaThemaindiﬀerencebetweenanontologyandalexicon,alexicaldatabaseorathesaurusisthatallofthelatterarelinguisticobjectswhileontologiesarenot(theyarelogicaltheories).Inparticular,whileconceptsand properties are deﬁned on logical grounds (through necessary and suﬃcient conditions, expressedthrough axioms), words are organized in a lexicon with respect to lexical relations such as hypernymy(broaderterm),hyponymy(narrowerterm),meronymy/holonymy(part-of/has-part),antonymy(oppo-siteterm).Theserelationsarenotdeﬁnedatalogicallevel,butratherdeﬁnedlinguistically,e.g.,throughso-calleddiagnosticframes(Cruse,1986),i.e.,bytypicalsentencesdescribingthecontextinwhichapairofwordsmayormaynotoccurgivenacertainlexicalrelationamongthem.Thus,ontologicallydeﬁnedrelations do not correspond directly to lexical relations, or citing (Hirst, 2004): “lexical relationships
between word senses mirror, perhaps imperfectly, certain relationships that hold between the categoriesthemselves .” Hirst also emphasizes the fact that ontologies are not linguistic objects (in contrast to lexi-
consorlexicaldatabases):“ Anontology,afterall,isasetofcategoriesofobjectsorideasintheworld,along
with certain relationships among them: it is not a linguistic object. A lexicon, on the other hand, depends,bydeﬁnition,onnaturallanguageandthewordsensesinit .”
For example, in the case of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the basic unit of representation, the synset,
can be understood as a categorygrouping together words according to similar meaning and which can
be organized taxonomically according to the hypernymy/hyponymy relation. Nevertheless, synsets arestill deﬁned on the lexical level and as noted by Hirst (2004) do not correspond directly to concepts,whicharedeﬁnedextensionallyandintensionallyinthecontextofcurrentKRrepresentationparadigms.However,ithastobenotedthatforthekindofapplicationsthatWordNetwasdesignedfor,itprobablydoes not matter what the semantics of a synset actually is. The semantics of a concept in an ontologyon the other hand, and more particularly in description logics, is however clearly extensional, i.e., themodel-theoreticinterpretationofaconcept Ccorrespondstoasetofobjectsinthedomainofdiscourse /Delta1.
However,conceptsalsohaveanintensionaldimension,axiomatizedintermsofsuﬃcientandnecessaryconditions, which, in many cases, is accompanied by a natural language deﬁnition, as many aspects ofthe concept deﬁnition are out of scope of logical formalization or it is simply not worth (in terms of acost–beneﬁttrade-oﬀ)capturingallaspectsformally.Thenaturallanguagedeﬁnitionthusbasicallyservesasaninterfacetothehumanreaderwhorequiresaprecisecharacterizationoftheintensionoftheconceptinordertomakesurethattheyareusingitintheintendedway.24.2.4.2 Is There Ambiguity in Ontologies?An important question concerning the interface of ontologies and language is that of ambiguity. HereweadheretothepositionofNirenburgandRaskin(2001)inthesensethat,whilelanguageisinherentlyambiguous,thequestionofambiguityofconceptsdoessimplynotarise.Ontologies,assymbolicsystems,rely on unique symbols to identify meaning through their logical connections to other symbols, suchthataccordingtothisviewconceptsaresimplyuninterpretedsymbolsthatcanbemanipulatedaccordingto some well-deﬁned rules (a logical calculus typically). However, as people interact with an ontologythroughexploration,population,querying,etc.,ontologyconceptsaretypicallyassignednaturallanguage

“labels” and deﬁnitions for human consumption. As these labels and deﬁnitions are speciﬁed in naturallanguage,theywillbeinherentlyambiguous,butthisconcernsthelabeland/ornaturallanguagedeﬁnitionofaconceptratherthantheconceptitself(asasymbol).
Obviously,conceptscanbemoreorlesspreciselydeﬁned,thusleavingmoreorlessroomforinterpre-
tation. In this case, concepts are relatively vague, but clearly not ambiguous in the sense that they havecompletelydiﬀerentintensions(meanings). Sometimesitissimplythecasethatthelogicalrepertoireathandisnotenoughtocapturethemeaningofaconceptaspreciselyaspossible(andinmanycasesthisiseven not necessary, depending on thegranularity thatis required for a certain application). An extremecase of a vague concept is that which corresponds to a word such as slim, which is inherently vague in
thesensethattheboundariesofsuchaconceptarenotcrispandmembershiptotheconceptisclearlyamatterofdegree.Butobviously, slimisnotanambiguousconceptwithcompletelydiﬀerentintensions.
24.2.4.3 The Role of Linguistic Distinctions in Ontology DesignHaving clariﬁed this, let us brieﬂy turn to the question whether ontologies should mirror distinctionsmade in natural language (possibly across languages). As we saw above, ontologies mirror the structureoftheworldandthusareaprioriindependentoflanguage.Thequestionabout“how”welearnaboutthestructure of the world or a speciﬁc domain is a completely orthogonal one and it might well be the casethat reading texts is the best way to learn about how the world is actually structured (we are not takinganystrongpositionhere!),butitdoescertainlynotfollowfromthisobservationthatanontologyshouldnecessarily mirror distinctions made in natural language. As argued by Hirst (2004), on the one handlanguage makes distinctions that are not relevant from an ontological point of view and on the otherhandthereareforinstancecategoriesthatarenotnecessarilylexicalizedinagivenlanguage,butcertainlyexist (e.g., the class of objects that can be ridden). It does also not mean that an ontology should reﬂect
the distinctions that a particular language makes. Ontologies should and can thus never be speciﬁc to acertain language as they are concerned with existence rather than lexicalization and existence is, in ourview,languageindependent.
A good example for the diﬀerences that can exist between the lexicalizations of a concept in two
languagesisprovidedbyNirenburgandRaskin(2004):Giventhecomplexlexicalizationfortheconceptwallin Italian
∗(inside wall: paretevs. outside wall: muro) and the simple lexicalization in English
(wallin both cases), one might be tempted to include the distinction between an inside and an outside
wall into a “Italianontology” but not into an “English ontology.” Clearly, such artifactsasan English orItalianontologydonotexist.Thisconclusionissimplywrong.Theonlyrelevantdecisioniswhethertheexistence of inside vs. outside walls is relevant for a certain domain or application. If yes, they will thenbeincludedintheontology(possiblyassubclassesof wall),otherwisenot.Thequestionwhetherthere
are direct lexicalizations of these concepts in diﬀerent languages is an orthogonal issue and simply notrelevantfromtheontologicalpointofview.

24.3 Ontology Engineering
The question of how to best develop an ontology is certainly a diﬃcult one. Everyone who has triedto model an ontology even for a toy domain has faced the many design decisions that one has to takeinto account.

24.3.1 Principles
Ontologies are engineered artifacts that, according to Gruber (1993), need to fulﬁll their purpose andprovide the desired functionality. Gruber in fact formulated a number of principles that any ontologyshouldfollow:
∗
1.Clarity: An ontology should clearly state the meaning of the deﬁned vocabulary. The deﬁnition
should be objective and independent of computational aspects. Ontologies should be formal inthe sense that deﬁnitions should be stated in the form of logical axioms (if possible), aiming forcompletedeﬁnitionsintermsofnecessaryandsuﬃcientconditions.Alldeﬁnitionsintheontologyshouldbedocumentedinnaturallanguage.
2.Coherence:Ontheonehand,ontologiesshouldbecoherentinthesensethattheaxiomscontainedthereinshouldbelogicallyconsistent(i.e., thecorrespondinglogicaltheoryshouldbesatisﬁable).On the other hand, not everything can be axiomatized, such that the overall ontology should beconsistentwithrespecttothenaturallanguagedeﬁnitions.
3.Extensibility :Anontologyshouldbedesignedinageneralwaysuchthatitanticipatesfurtherusage
thatitwasnotconceivedfor.Thus,itshouldideallybeeasilyextensibleandstraightforwardlyallowfor the introduction of new concepts, relations, etc. This should be a monotonic process, i.e., itshouldnotalterthestructuredevelopedsofar.
4.Minimal encoding bias: The speciﬁcation of the ontology should be as independent as possible ofissuesconcerningitsencodinginanyparticularontologylanguage.
5.Minimalontologicalcommitment :Anontologyshouldmakeasfewassumptionsasnecessaryabout
theworldbeingmodeled,thusallowingotherpartiestoreusetheontologyfortheirpurposes.
As Gruber mentions, at the surface there seem to be some trade-oﬀs between the above mentioned
principles(e.g.,betweenclarityandminimalontologicalcommitment),althoughtheaboveprinciplesarenotindirectopposition.TheinterestedreaderisreferredtoGruber(1993),formoredetailsandtwocasestudiesillustratinghowtheaboveprinciplescanbeapplied.
24.3.2 Methodologies
Thetaskofbuildinganontologyiscertainlynotatrivialoneandrequiresguidance.Thus,researchinthearea of ontology engineering has developed methodologies to guide the process of building an ontologyby describing some necessary steps to follow. Ontology engineering along these lines is a relatively newscience. In fact, the ﬁrst ontology engineering methodologies were proposed only in the early 1990s(comparePintoandMartins,2004),amongwhichtheonebyUscholdandKing(1995)hasbeenthemostinﬂuential,comprisingofthefollowingsteps:

Forthis,avarietyoftechniquescanbeused,suchasdeﬁningcompetencyquestions(UscholdandKing,1995),carryingoutinterviewswithdomainexperts,analyzingdomain-speciﬁctexts,etc.(seeRusselandNorvig,2003).Thedevelopmentofcompetencyquestionsisanintegralpartofmanymethodologies,e.g.,in the uniﬁed methodology of Uschold (1996) and in the OntoKnowledge methodology by Sure et al.(2004).Competencyquestionsclearlydeﬁnethepurposeandscopeoftheontologybydeﬁningquestionsthattheontologyshouldbeabletoanswer.
Theontology capture step has the goal of producing an informal model of the ontology by compare
UscholdandKing(1995):
1. Identifyingthe keyconceptsandrelationships inthedomain
2. Preciseand unambiguousdeﬁnitions (innaturallanguage)oftheconceptsandrelationships
3. Identiﬁcationofthe termsthatrefertotheseconceptsandrelations
4.Agreeing onalloftheabove
It is important to emphasize a few aspects of the ontology capture step as envisioned by Uschold and
King. First, this step is targeted toward yielding agreement between a number of interested parties onthe relevant concepts and relationships. Second, it is worth noticing that ambiguity is something thataccording to the above model has no place in the ontology, where meaning should be clearly speciﬁed,thusremovingallambiguities.Third,UscholdandKingclearlydistinguishbetweentheconceptlevelandthe terms that are used to refer to these, thus clearly separating the ontological level from the linguisticlevel.
Inthecodingstep,theinformalmodelproducedbytheontologybuildingstepisrepresentedinsome

acknowledge that reusing or integrating other ontologies is a nontrivial problem. However, they alsostressthatontologyreuseandintegrationisacentralandcrucialtaskinthecomplexprocessofdesigninganontology.WediscussthisissuefurtherinSection24.3.2.2.
ThemethodologybyUscholdandKingwaslatermergedwiththeTOVEmethodologybyGrüninger

The main lessons to be learned from all of the work on ontology engineering methodologies are the
following:

Having described the main ontology engineering methodologies, we now discuss issues related to
ontology engineering and orthogonal to the methodology adopted, i.e., the collaborative design of
ontologies,issuesrelatedtoontologyreuseaswellasdiﬀerent paradigms formodelingontologies.
24.3.2.1 Collaborative Aspects
Some deﬁnitions of ontologies state that they should describe a formalized and sharedvocabulary.∗
For this reason, some researchers have worked on methodologies that are inherently collaborative in
the sense that they support people (distributed parties in general) in the task of agreeing on certain
modelingchoices.Experimentshaveshownthatwithoutanyrulesorconstraints,developinganontology
in a distributed fashion can be very ineﬃcient (see Pinto and Tempich, 2004). As a solution to this,
methodologies have been proposed that take into account the collaborative nature of ontology design.
An example for this is the DILIGENT methodology (Pinto and Tempich, 2004; Tempich et al., 2005),
which has provided a framework for collaborative design by way of a meta-ontology of—let us call
them—“speech acts” that people can use to contribute to the discussion of an ongoing collaborative
engineeringproject.The“speechacts”borrowheavilyfromthediscourserelationsdeﬁnedinRhetorical

24.3.2.2 Ontology Reuse
MentionedasacentralstepinthemethodologyofUscholdandKing,integrationisacrucialstepwithin
ontology engineering as one of the purposes of an ontology is to allow for the reuse of knowledge in
diﬀerentcontexts.Pintodistinguishesbetweendiﬀerenttypesof“ontologyreuse”(seePintoetal.,1999;
PintoandMartins,2000):
∗It is a debatable issue whether the conceptualization, the ontology formulated at the knowledge level or the ontology
formalizedinagivenlanguageshouldbeshared.

•Fusion or Merging: The process of unifying various ontologies (typically on similar or relateddomains) into a new ontology. Hereby, the contribution of each source ontology might not beclearlyidentiﬁable.
•Composition or Integration: The process of selecting parts of certain ontologies (typically ondiﬀerent domains) and integrating them into a new ontology in a modular fashion as clearlyidentiﬁablesubmodulesdrawnfromotherontologies.
An essential prerequisite to merging or, more generally speaking, the reuse of ontological resources
are methods for ontology alignment (for a good overview see Euzenat and Shvaiko, 2007). Ontologyalignmentisconcernedwiththedevelopmentofmethodsforthealignmentofontologyelements(classes,properties)fromdiﬀerentontologies,basedontheirsemanticsimilarity.Ingeneral,threetypesofmethodscan be distinguished here: (1) structure-based methods that compute semantic similarity relative to thestructureoftheontology(similarclassessharesimilarparents, sisters, etc.); (2)instance-basedmethodsthat compute similarity based on the overlap in terms of instances for any given pair of classes (orproperties);(3)lexicalmethodsthatbuildonstringdistancebetweenthenamesofclasses/propertiesor,inmoresophisticatedversions,onthesimilarityoflinguisticcontextsofclass/propertyinstances(whichisonlytractableifasemanticallyannotatedtextualdatasetisavailable,e.g.,inthecaseofontology-basedinformation extraction). Once two ontologies have been aligned, they can be merged and queried in areallyintegratedway.
A diﬀerent, and more recent strand of research in ontology reuse is concerned with identifying
appropriate ontologies for reuse (merging, integration) from among the growing number of publishedontologies.Astheseincreaseinnumberaswellasquality,itwillbecomemucheasierto ﬁndratherthan
toconstruct an appropriate ontology for a particular application. On the other hand, as more and more
ontologiesbecomeavailable,thetaskofselectinganappropriateontologybecomesincreasinglydiﬃcult.Originally,thesolutiontothisproblemwassupposedtobehandledbyfoundationalontologylibrariesasdiscussedbyvanHeijstetal.(1997).However,inrecentyearsWeb-basedserviceslikeSwoogle,
∗Watson,†
and OntoSelect‡have been developed that enable a more data-driven approach to ontology search and
retrieval.Animportantaspectoftheseservicesistherankingofretrievedontologiesrelativetoakeywordqueryforinstance,or,asisthecaseofOntoSelect(BuitelaarandEigner,2008),aquerydocument.AWeb-based ontology, deﬁned in RDFS or OWL, is in many respects just another Web document that can beindexed,stored,andretrieved.However,duetothefactthatontologiesarestructuredobjects,consistingof relations, possibly also pointing to other ontologies, structural criteria are needed to rank them.Along these lines, Alani et al. (2006) have deﬁned, for example, ontology ranking measures exploitingthe structure of the ontology, including measures of “class match,” “density,” “semantic similarity,”“betweenness,” etc. The last two measures are based on the assumption that ontologies (as structures)are well-balanced in the sense that the modeling granularity is homogeneous over the whole ontology.However, practical experience shows that this is not always the case, as some parts of the ontology willbe modeled more in detail than others. Another set of measures or rather criteria for ontology selectionhas been proposed by Sabou et al. (2006). The focus here is more on the application of ranked/selectedontologiesandthereforeincludessuchcriteriaas“modularization”(Canretrievedontologiesbesplitupinusefulmodules?),“returningontologycombinations”(Canretrievedontologiesbeusedincombination?),and“dealingwithinstances”(Doretrievedontologiesincludeinstancesaswellasclasses/properties?)nexttomorestandardmeasuressuchascoverage.

Ontologyengineering methodologies in essence describe the process of ontology engineering at a meta-level,describing which steps need to be carried out in order to actually build an ontology. In this sense theyare the ontology engineer’s companion, guiding them in the process of building an ontology. However,current methodologies do not provide any support for making decisions about whether to include aconceptornot,tomodelsomethingasaclassvs.anindividual(isBordeauxwineaclassoraninstance?),asapropertyvs.aclass(shouldwemodelcolorsasdatatypepropertyofobjectsorasaclass?).Becauseofthis,Hovyclaimsthattherearecurrentlynoacceptedmethodologiesforengineeringontologies(seeHovy,2005). Still, there is no contradiction with what we have said so far in this chapter, because the notionof“ontologyengineeringmethodology”intheknowledgerepresentationliteratureisdiﬀerentfromwhatHovycallsanengineeringmethodology,i.e.,asetofguidelinestofollowwhentakingmodelingdecisions.Thisisdiﬀerentfromtheunderstandingofamethodologyasameta-descriptionoftheprocessofontologyengineeringintermsofstepstofollow.WewillrefertoHovy’smethodologiesas engineeringparadigms .In
thissensethereisindeedalackofacceptedontologyengineeringparadigms.Hovydistinguishesbetweenthefollowingparadigms
∗thatcanbegenerallyattributedtodiﬀerentschoolsofthoughtanddisciplines:
•The logico-philosophical/mathematical paradigm : Borrowing directly from the ideas of Aristotle
in the sense that the diﬀerent properties (diﬀerentiae) of things are responsible for introducingontological distinctions in terms of subclasses. As Hovy mentions, this paradigm features anunrivaled elegance and beauty but is more diﬃcult to implement in practice as it introduces toomany distinctions (leading to a combinatorial explosion) which we as humans would not alwaysperceiveasintuitiveor cognitivelyplausible. Second, therearemanythingswhichwe ashumansperceiveasdiﬀerentconceptsbutwewouldhaveahardtimespecifyingwhatthediﬀerentiaactuallyare(e.g.,whataretheessentialpropertiesorfeaturesof democracy ?tociteanexamplefromHovy).
Nevertheless, this is an important ontology modeling paradigm that has most notably lead tothe development of Formal Concept Analysis (Ganter and Wille, 1999) and inﬂuenced ontologyengineering methodologies such as the one by Bouaud et al. (1995) and further elaborationsthereof(Bachimontetal.,2002).AnumberofItalianresearchers(amongthemthepeoplebehindDOLCE (Masolo et al., 2003)) have recently started a project of building a knowledge repositorycollaborativelyrelyingondiﬀerentiatingcriteriadrawnfromformalontology(the SensoComune

In fact, we would claim that most of the ontologiesout there are produced in this way. We agree though that this makes ontological engineeringa highly subjective endeavor. But after all, everybody perceives the world diﬀerently and hasdiﬀerentneedsforengineeringanontology.Collaborativeengineeringmethodologies(seeSection24.3.2.1)areclearlyasteptowardreducingthissubjectivityandmakingpeopleatleasttoagreeondeﬁnitions.
•Thelinguisticapproach:Thelinguisticapproachtypicallyassumesthatanontologyneedstoreﬂectlinguisticdistinctions.Thisisindeedproblematic(seeour“muro”vs.“parete”exampleabove).Anontologyengineeredonthebasisoflinguisticdistinctionsneedstobelanguage-speciﬁc(unlessonetriestokeepitlanguage-neutralbyanapproachaspursuedbyHovyandNirenburg(1992)),suchthatdistinctionslikethecount/massdistinctionproducediﬀerentontologiesindiﬀerentlanguages(e.g.,“furniture” beingamassnouninEnglishwhile “Möbel”beingcountableinGerman,seeagain
Hirst (2004)). While this approach has inherent problems as there are concepts for which thereis no direct lexicalization (e.g., the so-called covert categories such as “all the things that can be
wornonthebody,” seeHirst(2004))andontheotherhandtherearemanylinguisticdistinctions
thatseemarbitraryandarenotdirectlyontologicallyrelevant(seeagainHirst(2004)onthis),theapproach has been successfully applied in developing language-speciﬁc thesauri as well as lexicaldatabasessuchasWordNet(Fellbaum,1998)(withaclearcognitiveinﬂuencethough).
•The computer science approach: Here we certainly have diﬀerent subparadigms. On the onehand, we have people modeling ontologies as a database schema, i.e., for describing data. Suchdata description ontologies are typically well-deﬁned in scope and do not generate too muchcontroversy (after all one models the data that is already there). Applications of such schema-oriented ontologies are important for data integration where data from diﬀerent sources (e.g.,databases) needs to be integrated in order to allow for uniform access. On the other hand, thereare people modeling ontologies according to computational aspects (against Gruber’s advice!),organizingknowledgesothatreasoningcanbeaccomplishedeﬃciently.

understanding of a certain area (such as the gene ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium,2001)). Theseontologiesaretypicallyorganizedforbrowsingorclassifyingresourcestofacilitateretrieval. In such a context it does not matter at all if ontologies are philosophically adequate orlogicallyconsistent.Infact,inmostcasesthetaxonomiesmodeledaresosimplethatthequestionoflogicalinconsistencydoesnotevenarise.Suchlightweightontologies(orshouldwerathercallthem vocabularies?) are so large and so dynamically evolving that it would be simply hopeless toapplyanymethodofformalsemanticstoensuretheircorrectness.
While it seems inadequate to base ontology design decisions only on distinctions made in language
(as argued above extensively), it is certainly the case that textual data can guide the development of anontology.Afterall,textsdealwiththeworldasperceivedbypeople,thusreﬂectingreality(atleastasitisperceived)andthushavingthepotentialtoguidetheontologyengineeringprocess.Forthisreason,somemethodologiescenteronthe(linguistic)analysisoftext.Forexample,Aussenac-Gillesetal.(2000)havesuggested to apply well-known techniques from NLP, such as term extraction, concordance extraction,clustering according to distributional similarity, etc., to the task of ontology engineering. Such a text-oriented approach to ontology engineering brings us ﬁnally to the topic of ontology learning , i.e., the
question of how data-driven learning techniques (such as NLP techniques applied to a corpus of texts)cansupporttheprocessofontologyengineering.WediscussthisinmoredetailinSection24.4.

24.4 Ontology Learning
As ontologies are domain descriptions that tend to evolve rapidly over time and between diﬀerent
applications, there has been an increasing development in recent years toward learning or adapting
ontologies dynamically, e.g., by analysis of a corresponding text collection. As human language is a
primary mode of knowledge transfer, ontology learning from relevant text collections seems indeed a
viableoption.Theterm “ontologylearning,” initsnarrowersensemeaning“ontologylearningfromtext,”
hasbeencoinedbyMädcheandStaab(2004)(seealsoMädche,2002)whoproposedaninitialsetoftasks
and methods for the automated generation of ontologies from natural language text—including term
extraction,taxonomyinduction,andrelationlearning.
Alloftheseaspectsofontologydevelopmentcanbeorganizedina“layercake”ofincreasinglycomplex
subtasks(Cimiano,2006).Thislayercake,takinginspirationfromtheW3C’ssemanticWebtechnologies
stack also known as semantic web layer cake∗has been proposed as a means for classifying approaches
according to the fulﬁlled ontology learning tasks. As depicted by Figure 24.4, the most fundamental
tasksinontologylearningareassumedtobetheacquisitionoflexicalinformationabout termsandtheir
respective synonymy relationships.Atomic concepts(orclasses)andassociatedlabelsconstitutethethird

deﬁnitionof generalaxioms .
Unavoidably, like any diagrammatic visualization or model, this layer cake represents a simpliﬁed
view on the ﬁeld of ontology learning. Since it has been tailored toward the requirements of ontology
learning from text, it has a certain bias toward purely lexical approaches to ontology acquisition (e.g.,
startingwiththeacquisitionofknowledgeabouttermsandsynonyms)withoutexplicitlydistinguishing
between syntactic and semantic aspects of ontologies. Moreover, it does not commit to any particular
ontology representation language and assumes an ideal, i.e., linear structure of the overall ontology
learningprocess,withouttakingintoaccount,e.g.,theneedformethodologicalontologyevaluationand
engineering. However, from our point of view, the ontology learning layer cake is a respectable ﬁrst

Additionally,and in order to identify only relevant term candidates, a statistical processing step will be included thatcompares the distribution of terms between corpora. The most widely used statistical measures for thisincludeTFIDF(Salton,1991),entropy(Gray,1990),andC-value/NC-value(Frantzietal.,1998),whereasthe signiﬁcance of term occurrences is determined by comparison with a reference corpus (Basili et al.,2001;Kilgarriﬀ,2001;Drouin,2004)orbyconsideringstructuralinformationthatisprovidedbyHTMLor XML documents (Brunzel, 2008). For a good overview of term extraction methods, see Witschel(2005) and Jacquemin (2001). An ontology learning system that builds primarily on term extraction isTERMINAE(BiebowandSzulman,1999).24.4.1.2 SynonymsThe synonymy level addresses the acquisition of semantic variants, i.e., words as well as more complexterms that have similar meanings and can be mutually exchanged within semantically similar contexts.Synonymy can be deﬁned within as well as between languages, where the latter in fact concerns theacquisition of term translations. Much of the work on synonymy acquisition has focused on the useof WordNet for English synonyms and EuroWordNet for multilingual synonyms and translations. Animportantaspectofthisworkistheidentiﬁcationoftheappropriatesenseofthewordinquestion,whichdeterminesthesetofsynonymsthataretobeextracted.

Most of the research in conceptlearningaddressesthequestionfromalinguisticortextualperspective,regardingconceptsasclustersofrelatedterms.Theseapproachesthereforeoverlapwiththoseintermextractionandsynonymydetectionasdiscussedabove.
Alternatively, researchers have approached the problem from an extensional point of view. Evans
(2003),forexample,derivedconceptsfromhierarchiesofnamedentitiesthatwereextractedfromtextualdocuments. In contrast, the KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2004) aims at learning the extension ofpre-deﬁned concepts like movie actors as they appear in Web documents. In the approach of Evans theconceptsaswellastheirextensionsarederivedsimultaneously,whereastheKnowItAllsystemessentiallypopulatesexistingconceptswithinstances.Thepopulationofexistingconceptswithinstancesistypicallyreferredtoas ontologypopulation.
Finally, intensional concept learning includes the generation of formal and informal deﬁnitions. The
generation of concept deﬁnitions can be based for example on the generation of a textual description intheformofagloss.Researchonthisareaishoweverquiterare.Infacttheonlyworkreportedinthisareais the OntoLearn system that derives glosses for domain-speciﬁc concepts from WordNet, text corporaandotherWebresources(Velardietal.,2005).Formaldeﬁnitiongeneration,incontrast,willbebasedontheextractionofrelationsandaxiomsasdiscussedinSections24.4.1.5and24.4.1.6.24.4.1.4 Concept HierarchyThebackboneofanyontologyisconstitutedbyasetoftaxonomicrelationshipsamongclasses.Eachoftheclassescanbedeﬁnedintensionally,e.g.,byadescriptivelabeloritsrelationshipstootherclasses,aswellasextensionallybyspecifyingasetofinstancesbelongingtothisclass.Sincetheunderlyingtaxonomyofanontology,independentlyoftheunderlyingontologyrepresentationlanguage,isofcrucialimportancefor the use of ontologies as a means of abstraction, many ontology learning approaches have focusedon the extraction of concept hierarchies. The vast majority of these approaches rely on lexico-syntacticpatternsforhyponymyextraction,commonlyknownas Hearstpatterns,namedafterMartiHearst,who
authoredaninﬂuentialandcommonlycitedpaperonthistopic(Hearst,1992)(seealsoadescriptionofthecurrentstateoftheartinAugerandBarriere,2008).ThefollowingexamplesaretakenfromHearst’sseminalpublication:

Thesepatterns,essentiallylinguisticexpressionsencodingbothlexicalandsyntacticconstraints,have

•Exception:NPexceptforNP(e.g.,“European countries exceptfor Spain”)
•Apposition:NP,thecapitalofNP(e.g.,“ London,the capitalofEngland”)
•Deﬁnites:thePNhotel(e.g.,“the Hiltonhotel ”)
•Copula:NPisaNP(e.g.,“Brazil isaSouthAmerican country”)
•Doubly anchored hyponym patterns as suggested by Kozareva et al. (2008), (e.g., presidents such
asClintonandPN)
Thelatterkindsofpatternsarecalled“doublyanchored”becausetheynotonlyincludethesuperclassor
hyponym,i.e.,“presidents”intheaboveexample,butalsoanadditionalinstance,subclassor,inlinguisticterms, a hyponym, i.e., “Clinton” in the given example. The aim is to have more “focused” patternsyielding a higher precision, which in this case can be used to extract other presidents than Clinton. Theabove pattern would for example match an occurrence such as “presidents such as Clinton and Bush,”where“Bush”wouldbeextractedasanewinstanceoftheclassofpresidents.
The performance of diﬀerent patterns has been systematically investigated (e.g., Aussenac-Gilles and
Jacques,2008).Finally,alargebodyofworkondictionaryparsingreachingbacktothe1980sand1990s(Cimiano,2006,Chapter6)aswellasrecentsimilarworkonknowledgeextractionfromonlineglossaries(Hovyetal.,2003)andWikipedia(Ruiz-Casadoetal.,2005;Suhetal.,2006;WeberandBuitelaar,2006)buildsalsoonlexico-syntacticpatterns.
Common to all pattern-based approaches to hyponymy extraction is the problem of data sparseness.
Since occurrences of lexico-syntactic patterns are comparatively rare in naturally occurring text, mostresearch nowadays concentrates on the use of search engines and therefore indirectly using the Webitself as a data set (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Cimiano et al., 2005; Blohm and Cimiano, 2007)—althoughthe enormous syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of Web documents poses many new challenges.Additionally, approaches toward the automatic generation of lexico-syntactic patterns (Etzioni et al.,2004; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Blohm et al., 2007; Brewster et al., 2007) also aim at increasingﬂexibilityandeﬀectivenessinhyponymyextraction.
Asetofverydiﬀerentapproachesrelyinsteadonhierarchicalclusteringtechniquesinordertogroup
terms with similar linguistic behavior into hierarchically arranged clusters (Caraballo, 1999; Faure andNédellec, 1999; Cimiano et al., 2004). The clusters obtained by this kind of approach are assumedto represent classes, the meaning of which is constrained by a characterizing set of terms. Clusteringtechniques clearly have the advantage of yielding a higher recall than pattern-based approaches becausethey are less dependent on more or less explicit manifestations of hyponymy. On the other hand, thegenerated clusters, respectively classes, often lack meaningful labels, although several approaches to theautomaticlabelingofclustershavebeenproposedinrecentyears(Kashyapetal.,2005).Clustering-basedtaxonomy induction seems to yield only low precision, especially on small to medium size corpora, ashereagaindatasparsenessconstitutesaseriouschallenge,e.g.,PantelandPennacchiotti(2006)claimthatclusteringmethodscannotworkreliablyoncorporawithfewerthan100millionwords.24.4.1.5 Relation ExtractionSynonymyandconcepthierarchiesdependontheparadigmaticaspectoflanguage,i.e.,theextentinwhichwords, terms, or more complex linguistic units can be exchanged across diﬀerent contexts (sentences,paragraphs,ormoreextensivediscourses).Relationextractionhowever,asdiscussedhere,dependsratheronthesyntagmaticaspectof language, i.e., theextent inwhichmore orless complex linguisticunitsareconnectedwithinasentence,paragraph,ormoreextensivediscourse.Syntagmaticrelationsaregivenbysyntactic structure and have been, for example, exploited in the acquisition of non-taxonomic relations(orobjectproperties)fromtext,speciﬁcallythroughtheanalysisofverbsandtheirargumentsasdeﬁnedlexically by subcategorization frames (see, e.g., Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005 on sports text and Ciaramitaetal.,2005onbiomedicaltext).Relationextractionisthereforealsoverymuchrelatedtotheproblemofacquiring selection restrictions for verb arguments as witnessed for instance by the ASIUM system thatenables an integrated acquisition of relations and subcategorization frames for the verbs that underlie

596 HandbookofNaturalLanguageProcessing
these relations (Faure and Poibeau, 2000). A major challenge in this is however the identiﬁcation of theright level of abstraction in determining the most speciﬁc restrictions for the arguments (domain andrangeinRDF/OWL)oftheextractedrelation(seeCimianoetal.,2006forsomesolutions).
Other methods for relation extraction include work based on association rules (Mädche and Staab,
2000; Antunes, 2007), in combination with shallow linguistic analysis on the level of part of speech andchunking,andcollocations(Heyeretal.,2001).Suchapproachesrequirehoweverahigherdegreeofuserinteractionasthegeneratedrelationslackanymeaningfulinterpretationaswellasnamingor“labeling”oftherelation(butseeKavalecandSvátek,2005forsomerelationlabelingexperiments).
Finally,asitisoneofthemostfrequentlyusedrelationsinontologymodeling,theextractionofpart-of
(“meronymy”)relationsissupportedbymanyontologylearningframeworks,suchasOntoLearn(Velardietal.,2005)andTextToOnto(MädcheandVolz,2001).Mostoftheapproachesformeronymyextractionareagainbasedonlexico-syntacticpatterns(Girjuetal.,2006;vanHageetal.,2006)asproposedoriginallybyBerlandandCharniak(1999).24.4.1.6 Axiom Schemata and General AxiomsThetaskoflearninggeneralaxiomsandaxiomschematahasnotattractedmuchattentionintheontologylearning community so far. Some early work includes the automatic generation of disjointness axioms(Haase and Völker, 2005; Völker et al., 2007) and complex class descriptions (Völker et al., 2007). Inaddition, semiautomatic approaches to taxonomy reﬁnement (Völker and Rudolph, 2008b) and theacquisitionofgeneraldomain-rangerestrictions(VölkerandRudolph,2008a)basedonFormalConceptAnalysis have been proposed in recent years. Closely related is also work on learning paraphrases (LinandPantel,2001a)andlexicalentailmentsaswellasonconceptlearninginInductiveLogicProgramming(see,e.g.,CohenandHirsh,1994;Espositoetal.,2004;Fanizzietal.,2004).ApproachestotheautomaticaxiomatizationofWordNethavebeenproposed,forexample,byNavigliandVelardi(2006)aswellasbyMoldovanetal.(2007),whoevaluatedtheirapproachinthecontextofaquestionansweringapplication.
