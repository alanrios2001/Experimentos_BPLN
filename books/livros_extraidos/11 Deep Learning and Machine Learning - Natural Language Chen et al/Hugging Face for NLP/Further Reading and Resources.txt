/four.pnum./one.pnum/nine.pnum.6 Challenges in Summarization
Whilesummarizationhasadvancedsigniﬁcantlywiththeadv entoftransformer-basedmodels,several
challenges remain. These include:
•Factual Consistency : One of the main challenges in abstractive summarization is ensuring that
thegeneratedsummaryisfactuallyaccurate. Modelsofteni ntroducehallucinations—information
thatisnotpresentintheoriginaltext. Researchersareact ivelyexploringways toincorporateex-
ternal knowledge and fact-checking mechanisms into summar ization models.
•Handling Long Documents : Many existingmodelsarelimitedbythemaximuminputlengt hthey
can process, typically around /five.pnum/one.pnum/two.pnum or /one.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/four.pnum tokens. This makes it difﬁcult to summarize long
documents effectively. New models like Longformer and BigB ird are designed to address this
limitation, but this remains an area of active research.
•Evaluation Metrics : While ROUGE is widely used for evaluation, it is not without limitations.
ROUGE scores focus on n-gram overlap, which may not always re ﬂect the true quality of a sum-
mary. Developing betterevaluation metrics that account fo r semanticsimilarity andfactual cor-
rectness is an ongoing challenge.
•Domain-SpeciﬁcSummarization : Fine-tuningsummarizationmodelsforspeciﬁcdomains,su ch
as medical, legal, or ﬁnancial texts, often requires large a mounts of labeled data, which can be
difﬁcult and expensive to obtain. Transfer learning and sem i-supervised approaches are poten-
tial solutions, but domain-speciﬁc summarization remains a challenging problem.
•Controlling Summary Style : Controlling various aspects of generatedsummaries, such as tone,
length, or level of detail, is a current research direction. The goal is to give users more control
over how summaries are generated, making them more adaptabl e to speciﬁc use cases.

/four.pnum./one.pnum/nine.pnum./seven.pnum Future Directions
As summarization continues to evolve, several exciting res earch directions are emerging:
•Multi-modal Summarization : This involves summarizing information from multiple moda lities,
such as text, images, and videos. Multi-modal summarizatio n has applications in ﬁelds like
journalism, where summarizing multimedia content could pr ovide comprehensive summaries
of news stories.
•Summarization with Knowledge Integration : Incorporating structured knowledge (e.g., knowl-
edge graphs) into summarization models could help improve t he factual accuracy and coher-
ence of generated summaries. This is especially important f or domains where factual correct-
ness is crucial, such as medicine or ﬁnance.
•Interactive Summarization : Developing systems where users can interact with summariz ation
models to reﬁne or guide the output is an emerging area of inte rest. This could involve allowing
users to highlight important parts of a document or specify w hich aspects they want to focus
on in the summary.
•Zero-shot and Few-shot Summarization : With the development of large language models like
GPT-/three.pnum, there is increasing interest in zero-shot and few-sh ot summarization, where models are
able to generate summaries without needing to be ﬁne-tuned o n a task-speciﬁc dataset. This
couldopenupnewpossibilitiesforsummarizationacrossdi fferentlanguagesanddomainswith
minimal labeled data.

and transformer-based models. By leveraging techniques li ke ﬁne-tuning, beam search, and length
penalties,it’spossibletobuildpowerfulsummarizations ystemsthatgeneratehigh-qualitysummaries

As summarization research continues, we can expect to see mo re sophisticated models capable
of handling longer documents, producing factually consist ent summaries, and adapting to different
domains and user preferences. By staying informed about the latest advancements, researchers and
practitioners can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with summarization.
/four.pnum./two.pnum/zero.pnum Casual Language Model
Acausal language model (CLM) [/nine.pnum/nine.pnum] is one that predicts the next word in a sequence of text given all
the previous words. In simpler terms, it can generate text by learning from existing text data. One key
feature of a causal languagemodel is that it cannot see futur ewords while generating the next one; it
only relies on past words.
In this section, we’ll explore how to use a pre-trained causa l language model using the Hugging
Face ‘transformers‘ library. We will also walk through an ex ample of how to generate text from a
model, step by step.
