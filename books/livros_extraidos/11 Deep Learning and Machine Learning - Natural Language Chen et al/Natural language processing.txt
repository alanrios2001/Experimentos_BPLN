/one.pnum./one.pnum./two.pnum The History of NLP
ThehistoryofNLPcanbetracedbacktothe/one.pnum/nine.pnum/five.pnum/zero.pnumswiththeadve ntofearlyAIresearch. Overtheyears,
it has evolved through multiple stages:
/one.pnum. /one.pnum/nine.pnum/five.pnum/zero.pnums – Rule-Based Systems: The earliest NLP systems were based on sets of handcrafted
rules that allowed computers to parse sentences, perform tr anslations, and answer questions. The

intelligence. [ /one.pnum]
/two.pnum. /one.pnum/nine.pnum6/zero.pnums – /one.pnum/nine.pnum/seven.pnum/zero.pnums: Symbolic Approaches and ELIZA During this period, symbolic AI dominated
NLP research. The famous chatbot ELIZA (created in /one.pnum/nine.pnum66 by Jo seph Weizenbaum) [ /two.pnum] simulated
conversation using basic pattern matching but was unable to understand the meaning of the input.
/three.pnum. /one.pnum/nine.pnum8/zero.pnums – Probabilistic Models: The /one.pnum/nine.pnum8/zero.pnums saw the introduction of probabilistic models in NL P,
moving from rule-based approaches to statistical methods. This shift occurred because of the lim-
itations of hand-coded rules when dealing with real-world l anguage complexity[ /three.pnum]. Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) and early machine learning algorithms were ap plied to tasks like speech recognition
and part-of-speech tagging[ /four.pnum].
/four.pnum. /one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/zero.pnums – Rise of Machine Learning: Machine learning techniques, particularly supervised lea rn-
ingalgorithms,becamewidelyadoptedinthe/one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/zero.pnums. Thisall owedformoreﬂexiblemodelsandbetter
handling of language variations. Corpora (large collectio ns of text) were used for training machine
learning models. [ /five.pnum]
/five.pnum. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/zero.pnums – Deep Learning and Neural Networks: The introduction of deep learning techniques,
speciﬁcallyrecurrent neuralnetworks(RNNs)[ 6]andtransformers[ /seven.pnum], revolutionized NLP.Modelslike
word/two.pnumvec, BERT [ 8], andGPT [ /nine.pnum]have signiﬁcantly advanced NLP’s capabilities, making it possiblefor
machines to generate and understand text with human-like ﬂu ency.
6. /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/zero.pnums–Large Language Models(LLMs): In recentyears, LargeLanguageModels(LLMs)have
dramatically advanced NLP. These models, such as GPT-/three.pnum, GPT -/four.pnum, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are trained
onvastdatasetsandusebillionsofparameterstounderstan dandgeneratetext. LLMsleveragetrans-
former architectures, which allow themto process and gener ate human-liketext at an unprecedented
scale[/one.pnum/zero.pnum]. They are capable of a wide range of tasks, including questio n answering, text summariza-

tion, translation, and creative writing. Their ability to g enerate contextually relevant and coherent text
without explicit rule-based systems marks a signiﬁcant shi ft in NLP[ /one.pnum/one.pnum]. With techniques like trans-
fer learning and self-supervised learning, LLMs require le ss task-speciﬁc training data, making them
highly adaptable across domains.
